<h3 class="h2head ls">PREFACE.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap negindent">I &ensp;<span class="sc">shall</span> not pretend to say
any thing here concerning the
origin of Fireworks; those who are
willing to be better informed of
that point, may have recourse to
the treatise of M. F***, on that
subject, who has handled this point
in a most elaborate manner; and
perhaps it may be no displeasing
surprize to the reader, to find that,
while he imagines himself only concerned
about an invention which,
he could not have thought to have
subsisted above 422 years, he is
carried gradually back to the age
of Augustus, and from thence to
the time of the Trojan war.</p>

<p>It is sufficient for me that Fireworks
have subsisted a long time,
and still continue to do so among
the politest nations of both Europe
<a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi"></a><span class="pageno">vi</span>
and Asia. I am very well aware
that it may here be objected, there
are already treatises published on
this subject, and some of those
voluminous ones; but then those
are either translations from the
French and Italian authors, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>
which in themselves are both imperfect
and erroneous; or else they
are very small abridgments, and
those little, not of the art itself,
only on some particular branches
of it.</p>

<p>I have endeavoured, in the following
treatise, to avoid prolixity
as much as possible without being
obscure; the rules I have laid
down, are as plain as was in my
power to make them, and I have
endeavoured to carry the reader in
by the most gradual manner, from
the minutest circumstances to the
highest, and have been careful to
<a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii"></a><span class="pageno">vii</span>
keep to the subject I first proposed,
only as an Essay on Artificial Fire-works.
I own I cannot help reflecting
with some kind of chagrin,
that, whenever we have had occasion
for any of these sort of diversions
to be exhibited in England,
we have almost always had recourse
to foreigners to execute
them; if this has been owing to
the ignorance of our own people
on this subject, I shall be very
happy if it is in my power to correct
it; if it is only owing to that
prevailing fondness we entertain for
every thing that is foreign, I know
no remedy for that evil but time
and experience.</p>

<p class="dropcap negindent">S<span class="ls sc">altpetre</span> being the principal
ingredient in fireworks, and a
volatile body, by reason of its aqueous
and aërial parts, is easily rarified
by fire; but not so soon when foul and
gross, as when purified from its crude
and earthy parts, which greatly retard
its velocity: therefore, when any quantity
of Fireworks are intended to be
made, it would be necessary first to examine
<a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a><span class="pageno">2</span>
the saltpetre; for if it be not well
cleansed from all impurities, and of a
good sort, your works will not have
their proper effect, neither will it agree
with the standing proportions of compositions:
but to prevent accidents I shall
proceed with the method of refining it.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">How to refine <span class="sc">Saltpetre</span>.</p>

<p>Put into a copper, or any other vessel,
one hundred weight of rough nitre
with about fourteen gallons of clean
water, and let it boil gently for half an
hour, and as it boils take off the scum;
then stir it about in the copper, and before
it settles put it into your filtring
bags, which must be hung on a rack,
with glazed earthen pans under them in
which must be sticks laid across for the
crystals to adhere to; it must stand in
the pans for two or three days to shoot,
then take out the crystals and let them
dry: the water that remains in the pans
boil again for an hour, and strain it into
the pans as before, and the saltpetre will
be quite clear and transparent; if not, it
wants more refining, to do which proceed
as usual, till it is well cleansed of
all it’s earthy parts.</p>

<a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a><span class="pageno">3</span>
<p class="hanging">N. B. Those who do not chuse to
procure their saltpetre by the above method,
may buy it ready done, which for
fireworks in general will do equally as
well.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">How to pulverise <span class="sc">Saltpetre</span>.</p>

<p>Take a copper kettle whose bottom
must be spherical, and put into it fourteen
pound of refined saltpetre, with two
quarts or five pints of clean water; then
put the kettle on a slow fire, and when
the saltpetre is dissolved, if any impurities
arise, skim them off, and keep constantly
stirring it with two large spatulas,
till all the water exhales; and when done
enough, it will appear like white sand,
and as fine as flour; but if it should boil
too fast, take the kettle off the fire, and
set it on some wet sand, which will prevent
the nitre from sticking to the kettle.
When you have pulverised a quantity
of saltpetre, be careful to keep it in
a dry place.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">How to extract <span class="sc">Saltpetre</span> from
damaged <span class="sc">Gun-Powder</span>.</p>

<p>First you must have some filtring bags,
hung on a rack, with glazed earthen pans
<a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a><span class="pageno">4</span>
under them, in the same manner as those
for refining saltpetre: then take any
quantity of damaged powder, and put
it into a copper, with as much clean water
as will just cover it; and when it
begins to boil take off the scum, and
after it has boiled a few minutes, stir it
up; then take it out of the copper with
a small hand kettle for that purpose, and
put some into each bag, beginning at
one end of the rack, so that by the time
you have got to the last bag, the first
will be ready for more; continue thus,
till all the bags are full; then take the
liquor out of the pans, which boil and
filter, as before, two or three times, till
the water runs quite clear, which you
must let stand in the pans for some time,
and the saltpetre will appear at top. Now
to get all the saltpetre entirely out of the
powder, take the water from the saltpetre
already extracted, to which add some
fresh water and the dregs of the powder
that remain in the bags, and put
them together in a vessel, to stand as long
as you please, and when you want to extract
the nitre, you must proceed with
this mixture as with the powder at first,
by which means you will draw out all
<a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a><span class="pageno">5</span>
the saltpetre; but this process must be
boiled longer than the first.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of <span class="sc">Sulphur</span>, or <span class="sc">Brimstone</span>.</p>

<p>Sulphur is by nature the food of fire,
and one of the principal ingredients in
gunpowder, and almost in all compositions
of fireworks; therefore great care
ought to be taken, of its being good
and brought to the highest perfection.
Now to know when the sulphur is good,
you are to observe that it be of a high
yellow, and if, when held in one’s hand,
it crackles and bounces, it is a sign that
it is fresh and good: but as the method
of reducing brimstone to a powder,
is very troublesome to do, it is better to
buy the flower ready made, which is
done in large quantities, and in great
perfection: but when a grand collection
of fireworks are to be made, the strongest
and best sulphur to use, is the lump
brimstone ground in the same manner as
gun powder, which we shall treat of in
the following part of the treatise.</p>

<a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a><span class="pageno">6</span>
<p class="p2 center larger">How to prepare <span class="sc">Charcoal</span> for
Fireworks.</p>

<p>Charcoal being a preservative by which
the saltpetre and the brimstone is made
into gun-powder, by preventing the sulphur
from suffocating the strong and windy
exhalation of the nitre. There are several
sorts of wood made use of for this
purpose; some prefer hazle, others willow
and alder; but there being so little difference,
you may make use of either which
is most convenient to be got. And the method
of burning the wood is this: Cut it
in pieces about one or two feet long, then
split each piece in four parts; scale off the
bark and hard knots, and dry them in the
sun or in an oven, then make in the earth
a square hole, and line it with bricks, in
which lay the wood, crossing one another,
and set it on fire; when thoroughly lighted
and in a flame, cover the hole with
boards, and fling earth over them close,
to prevent the air from getting in, yet so
as not to fall among the charcoal, and
when it has lain thus for twenty-four
hours, take out the coals and lay them in a
dry place for use. It is to be observed that
<a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a><span class="pageno">7</span>
charcoal for fireworks must always be soft
and well burnt, which may be bought
ready done.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">To make Artificial <span class="sc">Camphor</span>.</p>

<p>Camphor, in the Materia medica,
“is a body of a particular nature, being
neither a resin, nor a volatile salt, nor
an oil, nor a juice, nor a bitumen,
nor a gum, but a mixed substance,
dry, white, transparent and brittle,
of a strong and penetrating smell.
The Indians distinguish two kinds of
it, a finer and a coarser; the finer is
the produce of Borneo and Sumatra,
is very rare, and is hardly ever sent
into Europe; the coarser is the Japonese
kind, which is the common sort,
both in the Indies and in Europe.</p>

<p>“The camphor, which we meet
with in the shops, is also of two
kinds, differing in regard to the degree
of their purity, and distinguished by
the name of rough and refined camphor.
The tree, which produces
camphor, is a species of bay tree,
every part of which abounds with
camphor; but is not collected from
<a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a><span class="pageno">8</span>
it in the manner of resins, but by a
sort of chemical process.--The natives
of the place where the trees
grow, cut the wood and roots into small
pieces. And put them into large copper
vessels, which they cover with
earthen heads, filled with straw; they
give a moderate fire under them, and
the camphor is raised in form of a
white downy matter, and retained
among the straw; when the process
is over, they shake it out of the straw,
and knead it into cakes. These cakes
is are not very compact, but easily crumbled
to pieces; they are moderately
heavy, of a greyish or dusky reddish
white in colour, of a pungent smell
and acrid taste, and are what we call
rough camphor.</p>

<p>“Refined camphor must be chosen of
a perfectly clean white colour, very
bright and pellucid, of the same smell
and taste with the rough, but more
acrid and pungent.--It is so volatile
that merchants usually inclose
it in lin-seed, that the viscosity of
that grain may keep its particles together.”</p>

<a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a><span class="pageno">9</span>
<p>Now there is also an artificial camphor
for fireworks, which I shall here
give you the method of making; take
of gum sandarach pulverised two pound,
and of distilled vinegar enough to cover
it; put them together in a glass phial,
and set it for twenty days in warm horse
dung. Then take it out again, and pour
it into another phial, with a large mouth
to it; and expose it to the sun for a
month, and you will have a concreted
camphor in form of the crust of bread,
and something like the natural camphor:
which when you use must be
ground to a powder with a little spirits
of wine in a mortar. Though we have
here taught the method of making artificial
camphor, I would not recommend
it to those who chuse to make their works
to perfection, the natural camphor,
being by far the best.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">To make the <span class="sc">Oil</span> of <span class="sc">Camphor</span>.</p>

<p>The oil of camphor, which is sometime
used to moisten compositions, is
produced by adding to some camphor a
little oil of sweet almonds, and working
them together in a brass mortar, till it
turns to a green oil.</p>

<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a><span class="pageno">10</span>
<p class="hanging">N. B. Those works that have any
camphor in their compositions, should
be kept as much from air as possible,
or the camphor will evaporate.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of <span class="sc">Benjamin</span>.</p>

<p>Benjamin is a resin (much used by perfumers,
and sometimes in medicine); it
is brought from the Indies, where it is
found of different sorts; and distinguished
by the following colours, viz.
yellow, grey, and brown, but the best
is that which is easy to break and full of
white spots.</p>

<p>Benjamin is also one of the ingredients
in odoriferous fireworks, when reduced
to a fine flour; which may be
done by observing the following directions.
Put into a deep, and narrow earthen
pot, three or four ounces of benjamin
grossly pounded, cover the pot
with paper, which tie very close round
the edge; then set the pot on a slow fire,
and once in an hour take off the paper,
and you will find some flower sticking
to it, which return again in the pot;
this you must continue till the flower appears
<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a><span class="pageno">11</span>
white and fine. There is also an
oil of benjamin, which is sometimes
drawn from the dregs of the flour; it
affords a very good scent, and may be used
in wet compositions.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of <span class="sc">Gun-powder</span> and its original.</p>

<p>Gun-powder being a principal ingredient
in fireworks, it will not be improper
to give a short definition of its strange
explosive force, and cause of action,
which, according to Dr. Shaw’s opinion,
of the chemical cause of the explosive
force of gun-powder, is as follows.
“Each grain of powder consisting of
a certain proportion of sulphur, nitre,
and coal, the coal presently takes fire,
upon contact of the smallest spark: at
which time both the sulphur and the
nitre immediately melt, and by means
of the coal interposed between them,
burst into flame; which spreading
from grain to grain, propagates the
same effect almost instantaneously:
whence the whole mass of powder
comes to be fired; and as nitre contains
both a large proportion of air and
water, which are now violently rarified
<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a><span class="pageno">12</span>
by the heat, a kind of fiery explosive
blast is thus produced, wherein
the nitre seems, by its aqueous and
aërial parts, to act as bellows to the
other inflammable bodies, sulphur
and coal, to blow them into a flame,
and carry off their whole substance in
smoke and vapour.”</p>

<p>After having spoke of the nature of
powder, I shall in the next place proceed
to its original, though somewhat
uncertain; but it is imagined to have been
invented in the time of Alexander the
great, as Philostratus speaks of a city near
the river Hypasis in the Indies, that
was said to be impregnable and its inhabitants
relations of the gods, because
they thew thunder and lightning on
their enemies; but this perhaps might
be the effect of gun-powder, which, not
being known by any other people, might
very well be said to be thunder and
lightning.</p>

<p>This conjecture has been confirmed
by some travellers, who assert that it
was used in the East Indies, particularly
in the Philippine Islands about the
year 85, which is 1265 years before it
was known in Europe, where they say
<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a><span class="pageno">13</span>
it was not known till 1350, though, it
is said, there is mention made of gunpowder
in the registers of the chambers
of accounts in France, as early as the
year 1338, and Friar Bacon mentions
the composition of powder in express
terms, in his treatise De nullitate magiae,
published at Oxford in the year 1216;
but we find from most accounts, that the
Germans have the honour of the invention,
as is commonly reported.</p>

<p>I should give a description of a machine
for the trying of gun powder, but
they being so common, it would be needless;
yet, would have all those who practice
this art, know, that, when they make
sky rockets with powder, that it must
be of the best sort; but as to wheels, and
other common works, any powder will
do, only be careful that it is quite dry.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of the Compositions for <span class="sc">Gun-powder</span>
of different sorts.</p>

<p>Having treated of the nature of powder,
and its original, I shall here give
the proportion of each ingredient, necessary
for composing the different sorts
<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a><span class="pageno">14</span>
of gun-powder, it being proper that
every one who makes use of powder,
should know of what it is composed.
Therefore in the first place; I shall set
down the several compositions mentioned
In Casimir Siemienowicz’s grand art of
artillery, in which there are six sorts,
viz.</p>

<p class="hanging"><abbr title="One">I.</abbr> Saltpetre one hundred pound, sulphur
twenty five pound, and coal
twenty five pound.</p>

<p class="hanging"><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> Saltpetre one hundred pound, sulphur
eighteen pound, and coal twenty
pound.</p>

<p class="hanging"><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> Saltpetre one hundred pound, sulphur
twelve pound, and coal fifteen
pound.</p>

<p class="hanging"><abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> Saltpetre one hundred pound, sulphur
twenty pound, and coal twenty
four pound.</p>

<p class="hanging"><abbr title="Five">V.</abbr> Saltpetre one hundred pound, sulphur
fifteen pound, and coal eighteen
pound.</p>

<p class="hanging"><abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> Saltpetre one hundred pound, sulphur
ten pound, and coal eight
pound.</p>

<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a><span class="pageno">15</span>
<p>Mr. Belidor, in his Hydraulics, speaks
of a composition for gun powder which
is as follows, to thirty pound of saltpetre,
add five pound of sulphur, with
as much coal: but the proportion of
the several ingredients for powder, are
to be found best by experience. For tho’
there has been so much practice in making
powder, there has not yet been
ascertained a standing proportion of the
nitre, sulphur, and coal; but it is hoped
that in time this great and noble invention
will be much improved, and that
the different, and best quantity of every
ingredient, will be determined. At the
powder mills they generally allow for
wasting, in making up, one pound and
a half in a hundred. And their mixture
for a hundred weight of good powder
is thus: To seventy-six pound and a half
of saltpetre, well refined and dry’d,
twelve pound and a half of coal, and
as much sulphur, all which added together
makes one hundred one pound and
a half, which when worked up will nearly
weigh one hundred. As it is most certain
that gun-powder is capable of being
improved, I shall not omit any particular
that may be of service to such
<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a><span class="pageno">16</span>
ingenious gentlemen as are willing to
make experiments; for which reason we
shall here insert another composition for
powder, mentioned by an author on this
subject, whose name I have forgot, but
the composition is thus: Refined salt-petre
five pounds, sulphur one pound four
ounces, and charcoal seven ounces and
a half.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding you may have a
good proportion of ingredients, the powder
will not always be the same, for there
is a great deal depends on their being
well incorporated, corned and dry’d, the
method of which will be taught in the
next article.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">To restore damaged <span class="sc">Gun-powder</span>
to its proper strength.</p>

<p>It is most certain, that, if powder be
kept long in a damp place, it will become
weak and moist, and great part of
it will be formed into hard lumps, which
is a certain sign of its being damaged.
When powder is thus found, you will
also see at the bottom of the barrel some
saltpetre, which, by being wet, will separate
from the sulphur and coal, and always
<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a><span class="pageno">17</span>
fall to the bottom of the vessel
wherein the powder is contained, and
settle there in the form of a white
downey matter; but the only method to
prevent this, is to move the barrels as
often as convenient, and place them on
their opposite sides or ends, to which
they before stood: but although ever so
great care be taken of powder, and it be
kept as dry as possible, length of time
will greatly lessen its primitive strength.</p>

<p>Therefore when any of the above
mentioned accidents happen to your
powder, you may recover it by applying
to the directions here given; for example,
if you imagine that the powder
has not received much damage, proceed
thus. Spread it on canvas, or dry boards,
and expose it to the sun, then add to it
an equal quantity of good powder, and
mix them well together, and, when thoroughly
dry, barrel it up, and put it in a
dry and proper place. But if gun-powder
be quite bad, the method to restore
it is as follows; first, you must know
what it weighed when good; then, by
weighing it again, you will find how
much it has lost by the separation and
evaporation of the saltpetre; then add
<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a><span class="pageno">18</span>
to it as much refined saltpetre, as it has
lost in weight, but as a large quantity of
this would be difficult to mix, it will be
best to put a proportion of nitre, to
every twenty pound of powder; when
done, put one of these proportions into
your mealing table, and grind it therein,
till you have brought it to an impalpable
powder, and then searce it with a fine
sieve; but if any remain in the sieve that
will not pass through, return it to the
table, and grind it again, till you have
made it all fine enough to go through
the sieve; being thus well ground and
sifted, it must be made into grains in the
following manner, first you must have
some (copper wire sieves) made according
to what size you intend the grains
should be; these are called corning sieves
or grainers, which being provided, fill
them with the powder composition, then
shake them about, and the powder will
pass through the sieve formed into grains.
Having thus corned your powder, set it
to dry in the sun; and when quite dry,
searce it with a fine hair sieve in order to
separate the dust from the grains. This
dust may be worked up again with another
mixture; so that none of the
<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a><span class="pageno">19</span>
powder will be wasted: but sometimes
it may so happen, that the weight of
the powder when good cannot be known;
in which case add to each pound an
ounce or an ounce and a half of saltpetre,
according as the powder is decayed,
and then grind, sift, and granulate
it as before directed.</p>

<p class="hanging">N. B. If you have a large quantity of
powder, that is very bad, and quite
spoiled; the only way is to extract the
saltpetre from it, according to the usual
manner: for powder thus circumstanced,
would be very difficult to recover.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of <span class="sc">Silent Powder</span>, commonly
called <span class="sc">White Powder</span>.</p>

<p>It would be rather absurd for any one
to imagine, that it is possible for gunpowder
to have any effect without some
report, when it is plain and well known,
that the sound does not proceed from
the powder only, but from the air being
rarified by the expansion of the powder.</p>

<p>From whence it is evident, that any
composition acting with the same explosive
force as gun-powder, would certainly
<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a><span class="pageno">20</span>
produce the same effect, in every
respect. However as for such sort of
powder I never had any proof, nor ever
knew any experiment made of it, but
have so little opinion of it, that I should
not have given it a place in this work,
had it not been treated of by some authors
of note; and at the same time giving
every one, who is fond of this art,
an opportunity of making experiments,
and of knowing every thing belong
thereto.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">To make <span class="sc">Silent Powder</span>.</p>

<p>For the first sort, mix two pound of
borax, with four pound of gun-powder.</p>

<p><abbr title="second">2d.</abbr> Add half a pound of lapis-calaminaris,
and half a pound of borax, to
two pound of powder.</p>

<p><abbr title="third">3d.</abbr> To six pound of gun-powder,
half a pound of calcined moles, with
as much borax of Venice.</p>

<p>4th. To six pound and a half of saltpetre,
eight pound and a half of sulphur,
and half a pound of the second bark of
an elder tree, burnt and ground to a powder,
with two pound of common salt.</p>

<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a><span class="pageno">21</span>
<p>There are also many other methods of
making powder silent, according to report,
by using camphor or touchwood
instead of charcoal, or by adding
to the common powder burnt paper, hay
seed, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> When any of these ingredients
are to be mixed with common powder,
grind them together, and make them
into grains.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">To make <span class="sc">Gun-powder</span> of different
Colours.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the repeated trials
and experiments made by the greatest
artists, to add to the strength of gun-powder,
all have proved without success,
and most of them have agreed that
the present powder will not admit of a
fourth ingredient; therefore it is evident,
that any thing being mixed with
the present composition of gun-powder,
would rather reduce it’s strength than
add to it; consequently coloured powder
must be weaker than black; so that
the making of powder of different colours,
is only a fancy that serves to please
the curious, without any other effect.</p>

<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a><span class="pageno">22</span>
<p class="p2 center larger">To make <span class="sc">Gun-powder</span> white.</p>

<p>To six pound of salt-petre, add one
pound of the pith of an elder tree, well
dryed and pulverised, with a sufficient
quantity of brimstone to make it into
powder, which you will find in the
composition of gun-powder, or an ounce
of the salt of tartar, calcined till it comes
white, and then boiled in clear water,
till the water is all evaporated.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">To make <span class="sc">Powder</span> red.</p>

<p>Boil in water some brasil wood or
Vermillion and a pound of chopped paper;
and, when boiled for some time to
draw out the colour, dry and meal it
with a pound of sulphur, and eight
pound of saltpetre.</p>

<p>Or, to six pound of saltpetre, put one
pound of sulphur, and half a pound of
amber, and blood stone one pound.</p>

<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a><span class="pageno">23</span>

<p>Take eight pound of saltpetre, and

<p>Boil two pound of rotten wood, with

salt-petre.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">To make Blue <span class="sc">Powder</span>.</p>

<p>Boil some indigo in aqua vitæ, with a
pound of the bark of a young linden
tree, then dry and reduce it to a powder,
and mix it with a pound of brimstone,
and eight pound of saltpetre.</p>

<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a><span class="pageno">24</span>
<p class="p2 center larger">To make Pulvis Fulmanans, or
Thunder in a Room.</p>

<p>This composition is very simple, yet
has a very curious effect; it is made of
three parts of saltpetre, two of salt of
tartar, and one of sulphur, all ground
to a fine powder, and well incorporated
together. As the effect of this powder is
quite different to that of gun-powder,
so is there a different method of firing
it, which is thus: Put about two tea
spoonfulls of it into a fire-shovel, or iron
ladle, and set it over a slow fire, and
when it is quite hot, it will go off with
a violent report. There is something
surprising in the nature of this composition;
for as the common powder acts
every way equal, and makes the greatest
noise when confined, this, on the
contrary, acts only downwards, and
makes the strongest report when not
confined.</p>

<p>There is another sort of fulminating
powder, called fulmanans aurum, on account
of there being gold mixed in its
composition, which is done by a chemical
<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a><span class="pageno">25</span>
preparation; but as the preparing
of the ingredients require a tedious and
expensive process, I shall omit the method
of doing it, and let those who chuse
to make chemical experiments refer to
authors on that subject, by whom they
will find the manner of making this powder
fully explained. It is said one grain
of fulmanans aurum, when made to perfection,
and held on the point of a knife,
over a candle, will make a report louder
than a musket.</p>

and kept a few months, will be much
better than when just rammed, but will
not spoil, if kept dry, in many years.</p>

<p>Now as the beauty of this composition
cannot be seen at so great a distance
as brilliant fire, it has a better effect in
a room than in the open air, and may
be fired in a chamber without any danger;
for it is of so innocent a nature,
that, though with an improper phrase,
It may be called a cold fire; and so extraordinary
is the fire produced from this
composition, that, if well made, the
sparks will not burn a handkerchief,
when held in the midst of them; you
may hold them in your hand while burning,
with as much safety as a candle;
and if you put your hand within a foot
of the mouth of the case, you will feel
the sparks like drops of rain. When
any of these spur-fires are fired singly,
they are called artificial flower pots; but
some of them placed round a transparent
pyramid of paper, and fired in a large
room, make a very pretty appearance.</p>

<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a><span class="pageno">28</span>
<p class="p2 center larger">The Composition for the <span class="sc">Spur-fire</span>.</p>

<p>Saltpetre four pound eight ounces,
sulphur two pound, and lamp-black one
pound eight ounces.</p>

<p>Or, saltpetre one pound, sulphur half
a pound, and lamp-black four quarts.</p>

<p>As the spur-fire composition is very
difficult to mix, and the manner of doing
it quite different from any other, I
shall here treat of it separately; for example,
the saltpetre and the brimstone
must be first sifted together, and then
put into a marble mortar, and the lamp-black
with them, which you work down
by degrees, with a wooden pestle, till
all the ingredients appear of one colour,
which will be something greyish, but
very near black; then drive a little into
a case for tryal, and fire it in a dark
place; and if the sparks, which are
called stars, or pinks, come out in clusters,
and afterwards spread well without
any other sparks, it is a sign of its
being good, otherwise not; for if any
drossy sparks appear, and the stars not
<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a><span class="pageno">29</span>
full, it is then not mixed enough; but
if the pinks are very small, and soon
break, it is a sign that you have rubbed
it too much.</p>

<p class="hanging">N. B. This mixture, when rubbed too
much, will be too fierce, and hardly shew
any stars at all; and, on the contrary,
when not mixed enough, will be too
weak, and throw forth an obscure
smoke, and lumps of dross, without
any stars. The reason of this charge
being called the spur-fire, is because
the sparks it yields have a great resemblance
to the rowel of a spur, from
whence it takes it’s name.</p>

<p>The use of the above characters is,
that by the help of them, the different
receipts may be contracted to so small
a compass, that they may all be contained
in one leaf of a pocket book,
which is much less than any table that
has yet been invented. These signs are
also very convenient for those who travel.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">How to meal <span class="sc">Gun-powder</span>, <span class="sc">Brimstone</span>,
and <span class="sc">Charcoal</span>.</p>

<p>There have been many methods used
to grind these ingredients to a powder
for fireworks, such as large mortars and
pestles, made of ebony, and other hard
wood; likewise horizontal mills with
brass barrels; but none of these methods
has proved so effectual and speedy as the
last invention, that of the mealing table,
which is represented in <a href="#illo1">Plate 1.</a> Fig. 1.
This table it made of elm, with a rim
round it’s edge, four or five inches high;
and at the narrow end, A, is a slider,
which runs in a groove and forms part
of the rim; so that when you have taken
out of the table, as much powder as
you conveniently can, with the copper
shovel <a href="#illo1">Fig. 2.</a> you may sweep all clean
out at the slider A. When you are going
to meal a quantity of powder, observe
not to put too much in the table at once;
but when you have put in a good proportion,
take the muller <a href="#illo1">Fig. 3.</a> and
rub it therewith till all the grains are
broke, then fearce it, in a lawn sieve
<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a><span class="pageno">32</span>
that has a receiver and top to it; and
that which does not pass through the
sieve, return again to the table and grind
it more, till you have brought it all fine
enough to go through the sieve. Brimstone
and charcoal are ground in the
same manner as gun-powder, only the
muller must be made of ebony, for
these ingredients being harder than powder,
would stick in the grain of elm,
and be very difficult to grind; and as
the brimstone is apt to stick and clod to
the table, it would be best to keep one
for that purpose only, by which means
you will always have your brimstone
clean and well ground.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">To prepare <span class="sc">Cast-Iron</span> for Gerbes,
White Fountains, and Chinese
Fire.</p>

<p>Cast-iron being of so hard a nature,
as not to be cut by a file, we are obliged
to make use of the following method to
reduce it into grains, though somewhat
difficult to perform; but if we consider
what beautiful sparks this sort of iron
yields, no pains should be spared to granulate
such an essential material, to do
<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a><span class="pageno">33</span>
which you must proceed thus: get at an
iron foundry some thin pieces of iron,
such as generally runs over the moulds,
at the time of casting: then have a
square block made of cast iron, and
a square hammer of the same metal,
about four pound weight; then, having
covered the floor with cloth, or something
to catch the beatings, lay the thin
pieces of iron on the block, and beat them
thereon with the hammer, till you have
reduced them into small grains, which
afterwards searce with a very fine sieve, in
order to separate from them the fine dust,
which is sometimes used in small cases
of brilliant fire, instead of steel dust;
and when you have got out all the dust,
sift what remains with a sieve a little
larger, and so on with sieves of different
sizes, till the iron will pass through
about the bigness of small bird shot:
your iron being thus beat and sifted, put
each sort into wooden boxes or oiled
paper, to keep it from getting rust.
When you use any of this iron, observe
that you make a difference in its size, in
proportion to the cases for which the
charge is intended; for the coarse sort
<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a><span class="pageno">34</span>

<p>Having laid down, under the preceding
heads, the different compositions
used in fireworks by our modern artists;
I shall, in the next place, give some tables
of charges that were formerly used, according
to the several accounts given by
those authors from whom they are collected:
but if the reader will consider,
he will find the charges in these tables
to be very uncertain, by comparing their
method of determining the size and
weight of rockets, and the proportions
of ingredients thereto, with the method
taught in this work, which is so plain,
easy, and certain, that I have never yet
known it fail; and doubt not, but that
it will be so allowed by all who chuse to
make a tryal thereof.</p>

<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a><span class="pageno">51</span>
<p>The subsequent table is taken from
Siemienowicz, wherein is specified the
different charges of sky rockets, from
half an ounce to one hundred pound;
the charges being calculated in proportion
to the weight of a leaden ball of
the same diameter as the bore of each
mould; which bores are divided into
inches and lines<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1" id="fnanchor_1"></a><a href="#footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span>, and each line into
twelve equal parts, according to the
French method.</p>

<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a><span class="pageno">57</span>
<p class="p2 center larger">Remarks on the foregoing Tables.</p>

<p>In table the first, we find that the
compositions for all rockets under one
pound are made chiefly of gun-powder
and charcoal, which method has been
long proved erroneous in many respects:
first, that rockets made with such charges
will not keep long without spoiling;
secondly, that they are very uncertain
in performing their proper effect; thirdly,
they will carry but a short tail, with
a black and smoaky fire.</p>

<p>We also find those charges for rockets
above one pound, that are composed of
saltpetre, brimstone, and charcoal, to be
too strong; by which we should imagine
that, at the time when they were
used, the piercers did not bear the same
proportion to the rockets, as those made
use of by our present artists; for it is
on the size of the cavity in the composition,
that the effect of the rocket and
proportion of the charge depends: which
we shall endeavour to shew hereafter.</p>

<p>Table the second is given, by the author,
as an improvement on the first;
wherein he takes notice of the charges
<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a><span class="pageno">58</span>
being too many in number; he has
therefore reduced them to seven only,
which, according to his opinion, are
sufficient for rockets of any size: he also
observes, that the ingredients are expressed
in unequal quantities; which he
has likewise laid down in a more regular
order. By the same author’s account,
rockets were made in France, not many
years since, with the compositions mentioned
in his table. I shall not here pretend
to say, that rockets were not made
with the charges given in the above-mentioned
table; yet can affirm, by practice
and experience, that several of them
will not agree with our present moulds.</p>

<p>As to the method prescribed in the
third and fourth tables, it is difficult to
determine whether we shall praise or
condemn it, as they were wrote when the
art of making fireworks was in it’s infancy;
as may be seen by their strange
method of determining the proportion
of ingredients, and weight of rockets,
by the quantity of composition contained
in each case; which must have required
a very nice calculation, for at
that time, they had not fixed upon an
exact length for rockets, but made them
<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a><span class="pageno">59</span>
from six to nine diameters long: all
which differ so much from our modern
practice, that I never thought it worth
the trouble of making a trial: but am
of opinion, that very few of the charges
will answer.</p>

<p>In table the fifth, the compositions
are in proportion to the weight of the
rocket, with it’s head and stick, all
compleat; which head and stick together
are equal to the weight of the
rocket, according to the improvement
made by M. F***, as may be seen by
the second column from the top; he
also has added the diameters to the
moulds, in proportion to their height,
allowing each six diameters, which supposing
to be right, the rockets will be
nearly reduced to half their weight given
in the first column. On the charges
in this table I have made no experiment,
therefore cannot recommend them as
proof.</p>

<p>Having already given a variety of
charges for sky-rockets, in the preceding
tables, which are collected from the
principal authors on this subject, together
with remarks on the same; I shall,
in the next place, according to my promise
<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a><span class="pageno">60</span>
of not omitting any thing that may
be of service to the reader, add some
compositions for rocket-stars of several
colours, as inserted by former authors.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Compositions for Stars of different
Colours.</p>

<p><abbr title="One">I.</abbr> Meal powder four ounces, saltpetre
two ounces, brimstone two ounces, steel
dust one ounce and a half, and camphor,
white amber, antimony, and mercury-sublimate,
of each half an ounce.</p>

<p><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> Rochepetre ten ounces, brimstone,
charcoal, antimony, meal powder, and
camphor, of each three quarters of an
ounce, moistened with oil of turpentine.
These compositions are made into stars,
by being worked to a paste with aqua
vitæ, in which has been dissolved some
gum-tragacanth; and after you have roll’d
them in powder, make a hole through
the middle of each, and string them on
quick-match, leaving about two inches
from one to the other.</p>

<p><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> Saltpetre eight ounces, brimstone
two ounces, yellow amber one ounce,
antimony one ounce, and powder three
ounces.</p>

<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a><span class="pageno">61</span>
<p><abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> Brimstone two ounces and a half,
saltpetre six ounces, olibanum or frankincense
in drops four ounces; mastick,
and mercury-sublimate, of each four
ounces; meal powder five ounces; white
amber, yellow amber, and camphor,
of each one ounce; antimony and orpiment
half an ounce each.</p>

<p><abbr title="Five">V.</abbr> Saltpetre one pound, brimstone
half a pound, and meal powder eight
ounces, moistened with potrolio-oil.</p>

<p><abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> Powder half a pound, brimstone
and saltpetre, of each four ounces.</p>

<p><abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> Saltpetre four ounces, brimstone
two ounces, and meal powder one ounce.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">For Stars that carry Tails of
sparks.</p>

<p><abbr title="One">I.</abbr> Brimstone six ounces, antimony
crude two ounces, saltpetre four ounces,
and rosin four ounces.</p>

<p><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> Saltpetre, rosin, and charcoal, of
each two ounces; brimstone one ounce,
and pitch one ounce.</p>

<p>These compositions are sometimes
melted in an earthen pan, and mixed
with chopped cotton match, before they
<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a><span class="pageno">62</span>
are rolled into stars, but will do as well
if wetted, and worked up in the usual
manner.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Another Sort of Stars, which yield
some Sparks.</p>

<p><abbr title="One">I.</abbr> Camphor two ounces, saltpetre one
ounce, meal powder one ounce.</p>

<p><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> Saltpetre one ounce, ditto melted
half an ounce, and camphor two ounces.
When you would make stars of either
of these compositions, you must wet
them with gum water, or spirit of wine,
in which has been dissolved some gum-arabick,
or gum-tragacanth, that the
whole may have the consistence of a
pretty thick liquid; having thus done,
take one ounce of lint, and stir it about
in the composition till it becomes dry
enough to roll into stars.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">For Stars of a yellowish Colour.</p>

<p>Take four ounces of gum-tragacanth
or gum-arabick, pounded and sifted thro’
a fine sieve, camphor dissolved in brandy
two ounces, saltpetre one pound, sulphur
<a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a><span class="pageno">63</span>
half a pound, coarse powder of glass
four ounces, white amber one ounce
and a half, and orpiment two ounces.
All these ingredients being well incorporated,
make them into stars after the
common method.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Stars of another Sort.</p>

<p>Take a pound of camphor and melt
it in a pint of spirit of wine over a slow
fire; then add to it a pound of gum-arabick
that has been dissolved; with
this liquor, mix one pound of saltpetre,
six ounces of sulphur, and five ounces
of meal powder; and after you have
stirred them well together, roll them
into stars proportionable to the rockets
for which you intend them.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of the Colours produced by the
different Compositions.</p>

<p>As variety of fires adds greatly to a
collection of works, it is necessary that
every artist should know the different
effect of each ingredient; for which
reason, I shall here explain the colours
<a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a><span class="pageno">64</span>
they produce of themselves; and likewise
how to make them retain the same
when mixed with other bodies: as for
example, sulphur gives a blue, camphor
a white or pale colour, saltpetre a clear
white, yellow amber a colour inclining
to yellow, sal-armoniac a green, antimony
a reddish, rosin a copper colour,
and greek-pitch a kind of bronze or
between red and yellow. All these ingredients
are such as shew themselves in
a flame, viz.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">For a white Flame.</p>

<p>Saltpetre, sulphur, meal powder, and
camphor, the saltpetre must be the
chief part.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">For a blue Flame.</p>

<p>Meal powder, saltpetre, and sulphur
vivum, the sulphur must be the chief
part: or, meal powder, saltpetre, brimstone,
spirit of wine, and oil of spike;
but let the powder be the principal part.</p>

<a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a><span class="pageno">65</span>
<p class="p2 center larger">For a Flame inclining to Red.</p>

<p>Saltpetre, sulphur, antimony, and
greek-pitch, the saltpetre the chief part.</p>

<p>By the above method may be made
various colours of fire, as the practitioner
pleases; for, by making a few trials,
he may cause any ingredient to be predominant
in colour.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of such Ingredients as shew themselves
in Sparks when rammed
in choaked Cases.</p>

<p>The set colours of fire produced by
sparks are divided into four sorts, viz.
the black, white, grey, and red; the
black charges are composed of two ingredients,
which are meal powder and
charcoal; the white of three, viz. saltpetre,
sulphur, and charcoal; the grey
of four, viz. meal powder, saltpetre,
brimstone, and charcoal; and the red of
three, viz. meal powder, charcoal, and
saw dust.</p>

<p>There are, besides these four regular or
set charges, two others, which are distinguished
<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a><span class="pageno">66</span>
by the names of compound and
brilliant charges; the compound charge
being made of many ingredients, such
as meal powder, saltpetre, brimstone,
charcoal, saw dust, seacoal, antimony,
glass dust, brass dust, steel filings, cast
iron, tanner’s dust, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> or any thing
that will yield sparks; all which must
be managed with discretion. The brilliant
fires are composed of meal powder,
saltpetre, brimstone, and steel dust; or
with meal powder and steel filings only.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">How to make Cotton Quick-match.</p>

<p>Quick-match is generally made of
such cotton as is put in candles, of several
sizes, from one to six threads thick,
according to the pipes it is designed for,
which pipe must be large enough for the
match, when made, to be pushed in easily
without breaking it. Having doubled
the cotton into as many threads as you
think proper, coil it very lightly into a
flat-bottomed copper or earthen pan;
then put in the saltpetre and the liquor,
and boil them together about twenty minutes;
after which, coil it again into
another pan, as is shewn in <a href="#illo1">Fig. 4.</a> and
<a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a><span class="pageno">67</span>
pour on it what liquor remains; then
put in some meal powder, and press it
down with your hands, till it is quite
wet; afterwards place the pan before
the wooden frame, <a href="#illo1">Fig. 5</a>, which must
be suspended by a point in the center of
each end; and place yourself before the
pan, tying the upper end of the cotton
to the end of one of the sides of the
frame.</p>

<p>When every thing is thus got ready, you
must have one to turn the frame round,
while you let the cotton pass through
your hands, holding it very lightly, and
at the same time keeping your hands
full of the wet powder; but if the powder
should be too wet to stick to the cotton,
put more in the pan, so as to keep
a continual supply till the match is all
wound up; you may wind it as close on
the frame as you please, so that it does
not stick together; when the frame is
full, take it off the points, and sift dry
meal powder on both sides the match,
till it appears quite dry: in winter the
match will be a fortnight before it is fit
for use; when it is thoroughly dry, cut
it along the outside of one of the sides
<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a><span class="pageno">68</span>
of the frame, and tie it up in skains for
use.</p>

<p class="hanging">N. B. The match must be wound
tight on the frames.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Ingredients for the Match.</p>

<p>Cotton one pound twelve ounces, saltpetre
one pound, spirit of wine two
quarts, water three quarts, isinglass three
gills, and meal powder ten pound. To
dissolve four ounces of isinglass, take
three pints of water.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of Sky-rocket Moulds.</p>

<p class="dropcap negindent">A<span class="sc">s</span> the performance of rockets depends
much on their moulds, it is
requisite to give a definition of them and
their proportions, which are as follows:
They are made and proportioned by
the diameter of their orifice, which is
divided into six equal parts: as for example,
<a href="#illo1">Fig. 6.</a> represents a mould made
by its diameter A B, its height from C
to D is six diameters and two thirds;
from D to E is the height of the foot,
which is one diameter and two thirds;
F the choak, or cylinder, whose height
is one diameter and one third; it must
be made out of the same piece as the
foot, and fit tight in the mould; G an
iron pin that goes through the mould
and cylinder, to keep the foot fast; H
the nipple, which is half a diameter high,
and two thirds thick, and of the same
<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a><span class="pageno">70</span>
piece of metal as the piercer I, whose
height is three diameters and a half,
and at the bottom is one third of the
diameter thick, and from thence tapering
to one sixth of the diameter: the
best way to fix the piercer in the cylinder,
is to make that part below the
nipple long enough to go quite through
the foot, and rivet it at the bottom.
<a href="#illo1">Fig. 7.</a> is a former or rowler for the
cases, whose length, from the handle, is
seven diameters and a half, and its diameter
two thirds of the bore A B;
<a href="#illo1">8.</a> the end of the former, which is of the

two thirds long, the small part; which
fits into the hole In the end of the rowler

six diameters from the handle, and this

four diameters; and the hole for the

<p>It is to be observed, that all rammers
must have a collar of brass at the bottom,
to keep the wood from spreading
or splitting; and that the same proportion
be given to all moulds, from one
ounce to six pound. I mentioned nothing
concerning the handles of the rammers;
however, if their diameter be equal
to the bore of the mould, and two diameters
long, it will be a very good proportion;
but the shorter you can use
them the better, for the longer the drift,
the less will be the pressure on the composition,
by the blow given with the
mallet.</p>

<p>I would not advise any one who makes
rockets for his private amusement, to

skilful hand, and an expensive apparatus

so certain as ramming them over a
piercer, which I have found by experience.</p>

and prevent the composition from falling
out, which without this point it
would do; and, in consequence, the air
would get into the vacancy in the charge,
and at the time of firing cause the case
to burst. These sort of moulds are made
<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a><span class="pageno">74</span>

the cases are required, but the diameter
of the rollers must be equal to half the

<p class="p2 center larger">How to roll Rocket and other
Cases.</p>

<p>Sky rocket cases are to be made six
and a half of their exterior diameter
long, and all other cases that are to be
filled in moulds must be as long as the
moulds, within half its interior diameter.</p>

<p>Rocket cases, from the smallest to
four or six pound, are generally made of
the strongest sort of cartridge paper, and
rolled dry; but the large sort are made
of pasted paste-board. As it is very difficult
to roll the ends of the cases quite
even, the best way will be to keep a
pattern of the paper for the different
sorts of cases, which pattern should be
somewhat longer than the case it is designed
for, and on it marked the number
of sheets required, which will prevent
any paper being cut to waste: having
cut your papers of a proper size, and
<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a><span class="pageno">75</span>
the last sheet for each case with a slope
at one end, so that when the cases are rolled
it may form a spiral line round
the outside, and that this slope may always
be the same, let the pattern be so
cut for a guide: before you begin to
roll, fold down one end of the first sheet,
so far that the fold will go two or three
times round the former; then, on the
double edge, lay the former with its
handle off the table, and when you have
rolled on the paper, within two or three
turns, lay, on that part which is loose,
the next sheet, and roll it all on.</p>

<p>Having thus done, you must have a
smooth board, about twenty inches long,
and equal in breadth to the length of
the case; in the middle of this board
must be a handle placed length-ways;
under this board lay your case, and let
one end of the board lay on the table;
then press hard on it, and push it forwards,
which will roll the paper very
tight; do this three or four times before
you roll on any more paper: this must
be repeated every other sheet of paper,
till the case is thick enough; but if the
rolling board be drawn backwards, it
will loosen the paper: you are to observe,
<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a><span class="pageno">76</span>
when you roll on the last sheet, that the
point of the slope be placed at the small
end of the roller. Having rolled your
case to fit the mould, push in the small
end of the former F, about one diameter
from the end of the case, and put in
the end piece within a little distance of
the former; then give the pinching cord
one turn round the case, between the
former and the end piece; at first pull
easy, and keep moving the case, which
will make the neck smooth, and without
large wrinkles; when the cases are
hard to choak, let each sheet of paper
(except the first and last in that part
where the neck is formed) be a little
moistened with water: immediately after
you have struck the concave stroke, bind
the neck of the case round with small
twine, which must not be tied in a knot,
but fastened with two or three hitches.</p>

<p>Having thus pinched and tied the case
so as not to give way, put it into the
mould without it’s foot, and, with a
mallet, drive the former hard on the
end piece, which will force the neck
close and smooth; this being done, cut
the case to its proper length, allowing
from the neck to the edge of the mouth
<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a><span class="pageno">77</span>
half a diameter, which is equal to the
height of the nipple; then take out the
former, and drive the case over the
piercer with the long rammer, and the
vent will be of a proper size. Wheel
cases must be drove on a nipple with
a points in order to close the neck, and
make the vent of the size required;
which, in most cases, is generally one
fourth of their interior diameter: as it
is very often difficult, when the cases are
rolled, to draw the roller out, you may
make a hole through the handle, and put
in it a small iron pin, by which you may
easily turn the former round, and pull
it out. <a href="#illo1">Fig. 17.</a> shews the method of
pinching cases; P a treddle, which,
when pressed hard with the foot, will
draw the cord tight, and force the neck
as close as you please; Q a small wheel
or pully, with a groove round it for the
cord to run in.</p>

<p>Cases are commonly rolled wet, for
wheels and fixed pieces; and when they
are required to contain a great length of
charge, the method of making those
sort of cases is as follows: Your paper
must be cut as usual, only the last sheet
must not be cut with a slope; having
<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a><span class="pageno">78</span>
your paper ready, paste each sheet on
one side, then fold down the first sheet
as before directed, but be careful that
the paste does not touch the upper part
of the fold, for if the roller be wetted,
it will tear the paper in drawing it out:
in pasting the last sheet, observe not to
wet the last turn or two in that part
where it is to be pinched, for if that
part be damp, the pinching cord will
stick to it, and tear the paper; therefore,
when you choak those cases; roll
a bit of dry paper once round the case,
before you put on the pinching cord;
but this bit of paper must be taken off
after the case is choaked. The rolling
board, and all other methods, according
to the former directions for the rolling
and pinching of cases, must be used to
these as well as all other cases.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">To make Tourbillon Cases.</p>

<p>Those sorts of cases are generally made
about eight diameters long, but if very
large, seven diameters will be sufficient:
tourbillons will answer very well from
four ounces to two pound, but when
larger there is no certainty. The cases
<a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a><span class="pageno">79</span>
are best rolled wet with paste, and the
last sheet must have a streight edge, so
that the case may be all of a thickness:
when you have rolled your cases, after
the manner of wheel cases, pinch them
at one end quite close; then, with the
rammer, drive the ends down flat, and
afterwards ram in about one third of a
diameter of dryed clay. The diameter
of the former for these cases must be
the same as for sky rockets.</p>

<p class="hanging">N. B. Tourbillons are to be rammed
in moulds without a nipple, or in a mould
without its foot.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">To make Balóón Cases, or Paper
Shells.</p>

<p>First you must have an oval former
turned of smooth wood; then paste a
quantity of brown or cartridge paper,
and let it lay till the paste has quite
soaked through; this done, rub the former
with soap or grease, to prevent the
paper from sticking to it; then lay the
paper on in small slips, till you have
made it one third of the thickness of the
shell intended; having thus done, set it
<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a><span class="pageno">80</span>
to dry, and when dry, cut it round the
middle, and the two halves will easily
come off; but observe, when you cut, to
leave about one inch not cut, which will
make the halves join much better than
if quite separated; when you have some
ready to join, place the halves even together,
and paste a slip of paper round
the opening to hold them together, and
let that dry; then lay on paper all over
as before, every where equal, excepting
that end which goes downwards in the
mortar, which may be a little thicker
than the rest; for that part which receives
the blow from the powder in the
chamber of the mortar consequently
requires the greatest strength: when the
shell is thoroughly dry, burn a round
vent at top, with square iron, large
enough for the fuze: this method will
do for balóóns from four inches two
fifths, to eight inches diameter; but if
they are larger, or required to be thrown
a great height, let the first shell be turn’d
of elm, instead of being made of paper.</p>

<p>For a ballóón of four inches two fifths,
let the former be three inches one eighth
diameter, and five inches and a half
long. For a ballóón of five inches and
<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a><span class="pageno">81</span>
a half, the diameter of the former must
be four inches, and eight inches long.
For a ballóón of eight inches, let the
diameter of the former be five inches
and fifteen sixteenths, and eleven inches
seven eighths long. For a ten inch ballóón,
let the former be seven inches
three sixteenths diameter, and fourteen
inches and a quarter long. The thickness
of a shell for a ballóón of four inches
two fifths, must be half an inch. For
a ballóón of five inches and a half, let
the thickness of the paper be five eighths
of an inch. For an eight inch ballóón
seven eighths of an inch. And for a
ten inch ballóón, let the shell be one
inch and one eighth thick.</p>

<p>Shells that are designed for stars only,
may be made quite round, and the thinner
they are at the opening the better; for
if they are too strong, the stars are apt
to break at the bursting of the shell:
when you are making the shell, make
use of a pair of calibers, or a round
gauge, so that you may not lay the paper
thicker in one place than another;
and also to know when the shell is of
a proper thickness; ballóóns must always
be made to go easy into the mortars.</p>

<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a><span class="pageno">82</span>
<p class="p2 center larger">Of the Method of mixing Compositions.</p>

<p>The performance of the principal
part of fireworks depends much on the
compositions being well mixed; therefore
great care ought to be taken in this
part of the work, particularly in the
compositions for sky rockets. When
you have four or five pounds of ingredients
to mix, which is a sufficient quantity
at a time (for a larger proportion
will not do so well), first put the different
ingredients together, then work
them about with your hands, till you
think they are pretty well incorporated;
after which put them into a lawn sieve
with a receiver and top to it; and if,
after it is sifted, any remains that will
not pass through the sieve, grind it again
till fine enough; and if it be twice
sifted it will not be amiss; but the compositions
for wheels and common works
are not so material, nor need not be so
fine. But in all fixed works, from which
the fire is to play regular, the ingredients
must be very fine, and great care taken
<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a><span class="pageno">83</span>
in mixing them well together; and observe
that, in all compositions wherein are
steel or iron filings, the hands must not
touch, nor will any works, which have
iron or steel in their charge, keep long
in damp weather, without being properly
prepared, according to the directions
given in the following article.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">How to preserve Steel or Iron
Filings.</p>

<p>It sometimes may happen, that fireworks
may be required to be kept a
long time, or sent abroad; neither of
which could be done with brilliant fires,
if made with filings unprepared; for
this reason, that the saltpetre being of a
damp nature, it causes the iron to rust,
the consequence of which is, that when
the works are fired, there will appear
but very few brilliant sparks, but instead
of them a number of red and drossy
sparks, and besides, the charge will
be so much weakened, that if this should
happen to wheels, the fire will hardly
be strong enough to force them round:
but to prevent such accidents, prepare
your filings after the following manner.</p>

<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a><span class="pageno">84</span>
<p>Melt in a glazed earthen pan some
brimstone over a slow fire, and when
melted throw in some filings; which
keep stirring about till they are covered
with brimstone, this you must do while
it is on the fire; then take it off, and
stirr it very quick till cold, when you
must roll it on a board with a wooden
roller, till you have broke it as fine as
corn powder; after which sift from it
as much of the brimstone as you can.
There is another method of preparing
filings, so as to keep two or three
months in winter; this may be done
by rubbing them between the strongest
sort of brown paper, which before has
been moistened with linseed oil.</p>

<p class="hanging">N. B. If the brimstone should take
fire, you may put it out, by covering
the pan close at top: it is not of much
signification what quantity of brimstone
you use, so that there is enough to give
each grain of iron a coat, but as much
as will cover the bottom of a pan, of
about one foot diameter, will do for five
or six pound of filings: cast iron for
gerbes may be preserved by the above
method.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">The Method of Driving or Ramming
Sky Rockets, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>Rockets which are drove over a
piercer must not have so much composition
put in them at a time, as when
drove solid, for the piercer, taking up
great part of the bore of the case, would
cause the rammer to rise too high: so
that the pressure of it would not be so
great on the composition, nor would it
be drove every where equal: to prevent
which, observe the following rule; that
for those rockets, that are rammed over
a piercer, let the ladle<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_5" id="fnanchor_5"></a><a href="#footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span> hold as much
composition as when drove, will raise
the drift one half the interior diameter
of the case, and for those drove solid to
contain as much as will raise it half the
exterior diameter of the case: ladles are
generally made to go easy in the case,
and the length of the scoop about one
and a half of its own diameter.</p>

<p>The charge of rockets must always
be drove one diameter above the piercer,
<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a><span class="pageno">86</span>
and on it must be rammed one third of a
diameter of clay, through the middle of
which bore a small hole to the composition,
in order that, when the charge is burnt
to the top, it may communicate its fire,
through the hole, to the stars in the
head: great care must always be taken,
to strike with the mallet, and with an
equal force, the same number of strokes
to each ladle-ful of charge; otherwise
the rockets will not rise with an uniform
motion, nor will the composition
burn equal and regular; for which reason
they cannot carry a proper tail, for
it will break before the rocket has got
half way up; instead of reaching from
the ground to the top, where the rocket
breaks and disperses the stars, rains, or
whatever is contained in the head. When
you are ramming, keep the drift constantly
turning or moving; and when
you use the hollow rammers, knock out
of them the composition now and then,
or the piercer will split them: to a
rocket of four ounces, give to each ladle-ful
of charge sixteen strokes: to a rocket of eight ounces
twenty-one strokes: to a
rocket of one pound, twenty eight: to
a two pounder, thirty-six: to a four
<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a><span class="pageno">87</span>
pounder forty-two: and to a six pounder
fifty strokes; but rockets of a larger
sort cannot be drove well by hand, but
must be rammed with a machine made
in the same manner as those for driving
piles, which are so very common
to be seen, that I shall here omit giving
a description of them.</p>

<p>The method of ramming of wheel
cases, or any other sort, in which the
charge is drove solid, is much the same
as sky rockets; for the same proportion
may be observed in the ladle, and the
same number of strokes given, according
to their diameters, all cases being
distinguished by their diameters; in this
manner, a case whose bore is equal to
a rocket of four ounces is called a four
ounce case, and that which is equal to
an eight ounce rocket an eight ounce
case, and so on, according to the different
rockets.</p>

<p>Having taught the method of ramming
cases in moulds; we shall here
say something concerning those filled
without moulds, which method, for
strong pasted cases, will do extremely
well, and save the expence of making
so many moulds. The reader must here
<a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a><span class="pageno">88</span>
observe, when he fills any sort of
cases, to place the mould on a perpendicular
block of wood, and not on any
place that is hollow, for we have found
by experience, that when cases were
rammed on driving benches, which
were formerly used, the works frequently
miscarried, on account of the hollow
resistance of the benches, which often
jarred and loosened the charge in the
cases; but this accident has never happened
since the driving blocks<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_6" id="fnanchor_6"></a><a href="#footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span> have
been used.</p>

<p>When cases are to be filled without
moulds, proceed thus; have some nipples
made of brass or iron, of several
sorts and sizes, in proportion to the
cases, and to screw or six in the top of
the driving block; when you have fixed
in a nipple, make, at about one inch
and a half from it, a square hole in the
block, six inches deep and one inch diameter;
then have a piece of wood, six
inches longer than the case intended to
be filled and two inches square; on one
side of it cut a groove almost the length
<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a><span class="pageno">89</span>
of the case, whose breadth and depth
must be sufficient to cover near half the
case; then cut the other end to fit the
hole in the block, but take care to cut
it so that the groove may be of a proper
distance from the nipple: this half
mould being made and fixed tight in
the block, cut, in another piece of wood
nearly of the same length as the case,
a groove of the same dimensions as that
in the fixed piece; then put the case on
the nipple, and with a cord tie it and
the two half moulds together, and your
case will be ready for filling.</p>

<p>The dimensions of the above described
half moulds, are proportionable for
cases of eight ounces; but notice must
be taken, that they differ in size in proportion
to the cases.</p>

<p class="hanging">Note, the clay, mentioned in this article,
must be prepared after this manner;
get some clay, in which there is
no stones nor sand, and bake it in an oven
till quite dry; then take it out and beat
it to a powder, and afterwards sift it
through a common hair sieve, and it
will be fit for use.</p>

<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a><span class="pageno">90</span>
<p class="p2 center larger">Of the Proportion of Mallets.</p>

<p>The best wood for mallets is dry beech,
though some have preferred other sorts
of woods and have likewise pretended
to determine their exact weight, which
is not of much signification; however,
for the better instruction of those who
have not made a great progress in this
art, I shall here give a good proportion
for mallets; but at the same time would
have every practitioner know, that if
he makes use of a common mallet, of
a moderate size, in proportion to the
rocket, according to his judgment, and
if that rocket succeeds, he may depend
on the rest, by using the same mallet;
yet it will be necessary that cases of different
sorts be drove with mallets of
different sizes.</p>

<p>The following proportion of the mallets
for rockets of any size, from one
ounce to six pound, may be observed;
but as rockets are seldon made less than
one ounce, or larger than six pound, I
shall leave the management of them to
the curious; but all cases under one
ounce, may be rammed with an ounce
<a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a><span class="pageno">91</span>
rocket mallet. Your mallets will strike
more solid, by having their handles
turned out of the same piece as the
head, and made in a cylindrical form:
let their dimensions be worked by the
diameters of the rockets: for example;
let the thickness of the head be three
diameters, and its length four, and the
length of the handle five diameters,
whose thickness must be in proportion
to the hand.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of the Proportion of Sky Rockets,
with the Manner of heading
them.</p>

<p><a href="#illo1">Fig. 13.</a> represents a rocket compleat
without its stick, whose length from the
neck is five diameters one sixth; the
cases should always be cut to this length,
after they are filled: M the head,
which is two diameters high, and one
diameter one sixth and a half in breadth;
N the cone or cap, whose perpendicular
height must be one diameter one third.
<a href="#illo1">Fig. 14.</a> is the collar to which the head
is fixed; this is turned out of deal or
any light wood, and its exterior diameter
<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a><span class="pageno">92</span>
must be equal to the interior diameter
of the head; one sixth will be sufficient
for its thickness, and round the
outside edge must be a groove; the interior
diameter of the collar must not be
quite so wide as the exterior diameter
of the rocket; when this is to be glued
on the rocket, you must cut two or three
rounds of paper off the case, which will
make a shoulder for it to rest upon.
<a href="#illo1">Fig. 15</a>, a former for the head; two
or three rounds of paper well pasted
will be enough for the head, which,
when rolled, put the collar on that part
of the former marked O, which must
fit the inside of it; then with the pinching
cord, pinch the bottom of the head
into the groove, and tie it with small
twine. <a href="#illo1">Fig. 16</a>, represents a former for
the cone. To make the caps, cut your
paper in round pieces, equal in diameter
to twice the length of the cone you
intend to make; which pieces being cut
into halves, will make two caps each,
without wasting any paper; having
formed the caps, paste over each of them
a thin white paper, which must be a
little longer than the cone, so as to project
about half an inch below the bottom;
<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a><span class="pageno">93</span>
this projection of paper, being notch’d
and pasted, serves to fasten the cap to the
head.</p>

<p>When you load the heads of your
rockets with stars, rains, serpents, crackers,
scroles, or any thing else, according
to your fancy; remember always to put
one ladle-ful of meal powder, into each
head, which will be enough to burst the
head, and disperse the stars or whatever
is contained therein: when the heads
are loaded with any sort of cases, let
their mouths be placed downwards; and
after the heads are filled, paste on the
top of them a piece of paper, before
you put on the caps. As the size of
stars often differ, it would be needless to
give an exact number for each rocket,
but this rule may be observed, that the
heads may be nearly filled with whatever
they are loaded.</p>

<p>The last column on the right in the
above table, expresses the distance from
the top of the cone, where the stick,
when tied on, should ballance the rocket,
<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a><span class="pageno">95</span>
so as to stand in an equilibrium on
one’s finger or the edge of a knife. The
best wood for the sticks is dry deal, made
after the following manner; when you
have cut and planed the sticks according
to the dimensions given in the table, cut
on one of the flat sides at top, a groove
the length of the rocket, and as broad
as the stick will allow; then on the opposite
flat side, cut two notches for the
cord, which ties on the rocket, to lay
in; one of these notches must be near
the top of the stick, and the other facing
the neck of the rockets; the distance
between these notches may easily be
known, for the top of the stick should
always touch the head of the rocket.
When your rockets and sticks are ready,
lay the rockets in the grooves in the
sticks and tie them on. Those who,
merely for curiosity, may chose to make
rockets of different sizes, to what I have
expressed in the table of dimensions, may
find the length of their sticks, by making
them for rockets, from half an ounce
to one pounds sixty diameters of the
rocket long; and for rockets above one
pound, fifty or fifty-two diameters will
be a good length; their thickness at top
<a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a><span class="pageno">96</span>
may be about half a diameter, and their
breadth a very little more; their square
at bottom is generally equal to half the
thickness at top. But, although the dimensions
of the sticks be very nicely
observed, you must depend only on their
ballance: for, without a proper counterpoise,
your rockets, instead of mounting
perpendicularly, will take an oblique
direction, and fall to the ground before
they are burnt out.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">The Method of Boring Rockets
which have been drove solid.</p>

<p><a href="#illo2">Plate 2</a>, Fig. 18, represents the plan
of an apparatus, or lath, for boring of
rockets; A the large wheel which turns
the small one B, that works the reammer
C: these reammers are of different
sizes according to the rockets; they
must be of the same diameter as the top
of the bore intended, and continue that
thickness a little longer than the depth
of the bore required, and their points
must be like that of an auger; the thick
end of each reammer must be made square
and all of the same size, so as to fit into
<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a><span class="pageno">97</span>
one socket, wherein they are fastened by
a screw D: E the guide for the reammer,
which is made to move backwards
and forwards; so that after you have
marked the reammer three diameters
and a half of the rocket from the point,
set the guide, allowing for the thickness
of the fronts of the rocket boxes, and
the neck and mouth of the rocket, so
that when the front of the large box is
close to the guide, the reammer may not
go too far up the charge; F, boxes for
holding the rockets, which are made so
as to fit one in another; their sides must
be equal in thickness to the difference
of the diameters of the rockets, and their
interior diameters equal to the exterior
diameters of the rockets. To prevent
the rockets turning round while boring,
a piece of wood must be placed against
the end of the box in the inside, and
pressed against the tail of the rocket;
this will also hinder the reammer from
forcing the rocket backwards. G, a
rocket in the box. H, a box that hides
under the rocket boxes to receive the
borings from the rockets, which falls
through holes made on purpose in the
boxes; these holes must be just under
<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a><span class="pageno">98</span>
the mouth of the rocket, one in each
box, and all to correspond with each
other.</p>

<p><a href="#illo2">Fig. 19</a>, is a front view of the large
rocket box. I, an iron plate, in which
are holes of different sizes, through
which the reammer passes; this plate is
fastened with a screw in the center, so
that when you change the reammer, you
turn the plate round, but always let the
hole you are going to use be at the bottom;
the fronts of the other boxes must
have holes in them to correspond with
them in the plate. K, the lower part
of the large box, which is made to fit
the inside of the lathe, in order that all
the boxes may move quite steady.</p>

<p><a href="#illo2">Fig. 20</a>, is a perspective view of the
lathe. L, the guide for the reammer,
which is set by the screw at bottom.</p>

<p><a href="#illo2">Fig. 21</a>, a view of the front of the
guide facing the reammer. M, an iron
plate, of the same dimensions as that on
the front of the box, and placed in the
same direction, and also to turn on a
screw in the center. N, the rocket box,
which slides backwards and forwards:
when you have fixed a rocket in the box,
push it forwards against the reammer;
<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a><span class="pageno">99</span>
and when you think the scoop of the
reammer is full, draw the box back, and
knock out the composition; this you
must do till the rocket is bored, or it
will be in danger of taking fire; and if
you bore in a hurry, wet the end of the
reammer now and then with oil to keep
it cool.</p>

<p>Having bored a number of rockets,
you must have taps of different sorts according
to the rockets. These taps are a
little longer than the bore, but when
you use them, mark them three diameters
and a half from the point, allowing
for the thickness of the rocket’s neck;
then, holding the rocket in one hand, you
tap it with the other. In order to explain
these taps, I have represented one by
<a href="#illo2">Fig. 22</a>. They are made in the same proportion
as the fixed piercers, and are
hollowed their whole length.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of a Hand Machine used for boring
of Rockets instead of a Lathe.</p>

<p>Those sort of machines answer very
well, but not so expeditious as the lathe,
nor are they so expensive to make; they
<a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a><span class="pageno">100</span>
may be worked by one man; but the
lathe will require three. <a href="#illo2">Fig. 23</a>, represents
the machine. O, the rocket
boxes, which are to be fixed and not
to slide as those in the lathe. P Q, are
guides for the reammers, that are made
to slide together, as the reammer moves
forward: the reammers for these sort of
machines must be made of a proper
length, allowing for the thickness of the
front of the boxes, and the length of the
mouth and neck of the case: on the
square end of these reammers, must be
a round shoulder of iron, to turn against
the outside of the guide Q, by which
means the guides are forced forwards.
R, the stock which turns the reammer,
and while turning must be pressed towards
the rocket, by the body of the
man who works it; all the reammers
are to be made to fit one stock. This
machine as well as the lathe is made by
the scale in the same plate.</p>

<a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a><span class="pageno">101</span>
<p class="p2 center larger">The Manner of making large
Gerbes.</p>

<p><a href="#illo2">Fig. 24</a>, represents a wooden former;
25, a gerbe compleat, with its foot or
stand. The cases for gerbes are made
very strong, on account of the strength
of the composition; which, when fired,
comes out with great velocity; therefore,
to prevent their bursting, the paper
should be pasted, and the cases made as
thick at the top as at the bottom; they
ought also to have very long necks, for
this reason; first, that the particles of
iron will have more time to be heated,
by meeting with greater resistance in
getting out, than with a short neck,
which would be burnt too wide before
the charge be consumed, and spoil the
effect: Secondly, that with long necks
the stars will be thrown to a great
height, and will not fall before they are
spent, or spread too much; but, when
made to perfection, will rise and spread
in such a manner as to form exactly a
wheat-sheaf.</p>

<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a><span class="pageno">102</span>
<p>In the ramming of gerbes, there will
be no need of a mould, the cases being
sufficiently strong to support themselves;
but you are to be careful, before you begin
to ram, to have a piece of wood
made to fit in the neck; for if this be
not done, the composition will fall into
the neck, and leave a vacancy in the
case, which, as I said before, will cause
the case to burst as soon as the fire arrives
at the vacancy: you must likewise
observe, that the first ladle of charge,
or two, if you think proper, be of some
weak composition. When the case is
filled, take out the piece of wood, and
fill the neck with some slow charge.
Gerbes are generally made about six diameters
long, from the bottom to the
top of the neck; their bore must be one
fifth narrower at top than at bottom.
The neck S is one sixth diameter and
three fourths long. T, a wooden foot
or stand, on which the gerbe is fixed.
This may be made with a choak or cylinder,
four or five inches long, to fit
the inside of the case, or with a hole in
it to put in the gerbe; both these methods
will answer the same. Gerbes
produce a most brilliant fire, and are very
<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a><span class="pageno">103</span>
when a number of them are fixed in
the front of a building, or a collection
of fireworks.</p>

<p class="hanging">N. B. Gerbes are made by their diameters,
and their cases at bottom one
fourth thick. The method of finding the
interior diameter of a gerbe is thus: Supposing
you would have the exterior diameter
of the case, when made, to be five
inches, then, by taking two fourths for
the sides of the case, there will remain

which will be a very good size. These

<p>Small gerbes may be made of four,
eight ounces, or one pound cases, pasted
and made very strong, of what length
you please; but, before you fill them,
drive in dry clay one diameter of their
orifice high, and when you have filled
a case, bore a vent through the center
of the clay to the composition; the
common proportion will do for the vent,
which must be primed with a slow

<p><a href="#illo2">Fig. 26</a>, a former, and 27, an elm
foot for the mortar; 28, a mortar compleat;
these mortars are best when made
with paste-board; your paste-board must
be well pasted before you begin; or, instead
of paste, you may use glue. For
a coehorn mortar, which is four inches
two fifths diameter, roll the paste-board
on the former one sixth of its diameter
thick; and, when dry, cut one end
smooth and even, then nail and glue it
on the upper part of the foot; when
done, cut off the paste-board at top, allowing
for the length of the mortar two
diameters and a half from the mouth of
the powder chamber; then bind the
mortar round with a strong cord wetted
with glue. U, the bottom part of the
foot, is one diameter two thirds broad,
and one diameter high; and that part
which goes into the mortar is two thirds
of it’s diameter high. W, is a copper
<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a><span class="pageno">105</span>
chamber for powder, made in a conical
form, and is one third of the diameter
wide, and one and a half of its own diameter
long; in the center of the bottom
of this chamber, make a small hole
a little way down the foot; this hole
must be met by another of the same size
made in the side of the foot, as is shewn
in <a href="#illo2">Fig. 28</a>. If these holes are made
true, and a copper pipe fitted into both,
the mortar when loaded will prime itself,
for the powder will naturally fall to the
bottom of the first hole; then, by putting
a bit of quick-match in the side
hole, your mortar will be ready to be
fired.</p>

<p>Mortars of five and a half, eight, and
ten inches diameter, may be made of
paper, or paste-board, by the above method,
and in the same proportion; but
if larger, it will be best to have them made
of brass. N. B. The copper chamber,
must have a small rim round its
edge with holes in it, for screws to make
it fast in the foot.</p>

<p class="p2 hanging larger">The Manner of loading Air Ballóóns,
with the Number of Stars,
Serpents, Snakes, Rain-falls, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>
contained in Shells of each Nature.</p>

<p class="dropcap negindent">A<span class="sc">s</span> ballóóns are held in great esteem,
by most admirers of fire works, I
shall here give a full description of them
in every particular, in so clear a manner,
that a young practitioner may, by taking
a little pains, be pretty certain of
succeeding the first trial.</p>

<p>When you fill your shells, you must
first put in the serpents, rains, stars, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>
or whatever they are composed of; then
the blowing powder; but the shells must
not be quite filled; all those things must
be put in at the fuze hole; but marrons,
<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a><span class="pageno">107</span>
being too large to go in at the fuze hole,
must be put in before the inside shell be
joined. When the shells are loaded,
glue and drive in the fuzes very tight.
Of these fuzes we shall say more hereafter;
but shall here give the diameter
of the fuze hole in ballóóns of each nature,
which are as follows. For a coehorn
ballóón, let the diameter of the
fuze hole be seven eighths of an inch.
For a royal ballóón, which is near five
inches and a half diameter, make the
fuze hole one inch one eighth diameter.
For an eight inch ballóón, one inch three
eighths: and for a ten inch ballóón, one
inch five eighths.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger"><span class="lswide">REMARK</span>S.</p>

<p>Ballóóns filled with crackers, reports,
and marrons, make no great show of
themselves, nor are they very pleasing
to the eye, for they represent nothing
more than a number of pale white flashes,
followed by a variety of reports; which
altogether make but a very indifferent
appearance when fired with illuminated
ballóóns, which are so beautiful and
<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a><span class="pageno">114</span>
brilliant, as to cast forth such lustre
that will dazzle the eyes of the spectators
for some time; on this consideration,
I do not think it worth while loading
shells of a large nature, with things
that afford so little pleasure: but they
have a pretty good effect in royal
shells, when thrown among a number
of air works, such as pots des brins or
flights of rockets, in order to alarm
the people with a thundering in the air.
For they will not know from whence
the reports came, if fired exactly at the
same time with the other works, and
the fuze made to carry a small fire. But
if any one thinks proper to make large
ballóóns of this sort, it is only observing
a proportion of the blowing and firing
powder, and the length of the fuze, for
shells of the same dimensions as those
you intend to make. These kind of
ballóóns are lighter than any other sort,
by reason of the crackers being light
of themselves, and not lying close in
the shells. It must be observed, when
you fire light ballóóns, not to put so
much powder in the mortar as for heavy
ones.</p>

<p>Fuzes for air ballóóns are sometimes
turned out of dry beech, with a cup at
<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a><span class="pageno">119</span>
top, to hold the quick-match, as you
see in <a href="#illo2">Plate <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></a> Fig. 28, but if made
with pasted paper, they will do as well:
the diameter of the former for fuzes for
coehorn ballóóns, must be half an inch;
for a royal fuze, five eighths of an inch;
for an eight inch fuze, three quarters of
an inch; and for a ten inch fuze, seven
eighths of an inch. Having rolled your
cases, pinch and tie them almost close at
one end; then drive them down, and
let them dry; before you begin to fill
them, mark, on the out side of the case,
the length of charge required, allowing
for the thickness of the bottom; and
when you have rammed in the composition,
take two pieces of quick-match,
about six inches long, and lay one end of
each on the charge, and then a little
meal powder, which ram down hard;
the loose ends of the match double up
into the top of the fuze, and cover it
with a paper cap to keep it dry. When
you put the shells in the mortars, uncap
the fuzes, and pull out the loose ends of
the match, and let them hang on the sides
of the ballóóns; the use of the match
is, to receive the fire from the powder in
<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a><span class="pageno">120</span>
the chamber of the mortar, in order to
light the fuze: the shell being put in
the mortar with the fuze uppermost,
and exactly in the center; sprinkle over
it a little meal-powder, and it will be
ready to be fired. Fuzes made of wood
must be longer than those of paper, and
not bored quite through, but left solid
about half an inch at bottom; and when
you use them, saw them off to a proper
length, measuring the charge from the

<p>Having filled some cases within about
one diameter and a half, drive in a ladle
full of clay, then pinch their ends close,
and drive them down with a mallet;
when done, find the center of gravity of
each case, where you nail and tie a stick
which should be half an inch broad at
the middle, and run a little narrower to
the ends these sticks must have their
ends turned upwards, so that the cases
may turn horizontally on their centers:
at the opposite sides of the cases at each
end, bore a hole close to the clay with
<a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a><span class="pageno">121</span>
a gimblet, the size of the neck of a
common case of the same nature; from
these holes draw a line round the case,
and at the under part of the case bore a
hole, with the same gimblet, within
half a diameter of each line towards
the center; then from one hole to the
other draw a right line. This line divide
into three equal parts, and at X and Y,
Fig. 29, <a href="#illo3">Plate <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></a> bore a hole, then
from these holes to the other two, lead
a quick-match, over which paste a thin
paper. <a href="#illo3">Fig. 30</a>, represents a tourbillon
as it should lay to be fired, with a leader
from one side hole A, to the other
B. When you fire tourbillons, lay them
on a smooth table, with their sticks
downwards, and burn the leader thro’
the middle with a port fire. They
should spin three or sour seconds on the
table before they rise, which is about the
time the composition will be burning,
from the side holes to those at bottom.</p>

<p>To tourbillons may be fixed reports,
in this manner; in the center of the
case at top, make a small hole, and in
the middle of the report make another;
then place them together, and tie on
the report, and with a single paper secure
<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a><span class="pageno">122</span>
it from sire, this being done your
tourbillon is compleated. By this method
you may fix on tourbillons, small
cones of stars, rains, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> but be careful
not to load them too much. One
eighth of an inch will be enough for
the thickness of the sticks, and their
length equal to that of the cases.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">The Manner of making Mortars,
for throwing Aigrettes and loading
and firing the same.</p>

<p>Mortars used for throwing aigrettes are
generally made of paste-board, of the
same thickness as ballóón mortars, and
two diameters and a half long in the
inside from the top of the foot; the foot
must be made of elm without a chamber,
but flat at top, and in the same proportion
as those for ballóón mortars;
these sort of mortars must also be bound
round with cord as before mentioned;
sometimes eight or nine of these sort of
mortars, of about three or four inches
diameter, are bound all together so as
to appear but one; but when they are
made for this purpose, the bottom of
<a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a><span class="pageno">123</span>
the foot must be of the same diameter
as the mortars; and only half a diameter
high. Your mortars being bound
well together, fix them on a heavy solid
block of wood: to load these mortars,
first put on the inside bottom of
each, a piece of paper, and on it spread
one ounce and a half of meal and corn
powder mixed; then tie your serpents
up in parcels with quick-match, and
put them in the mortar with their mouths
downwards; but take care that the parcels
do not sit too tight in the mortars,
and that all the serpents have been well
primed with powder, wetted with
spirit of wine; on the top of the serpents
in each mortar lay some paper or
tow; then carry a leader from one mortar
to the other all round, and then from
all the outside mortars into that in the
middle; these leaders must be put between
the cases, and the sides of the
mortar down to the powder at bottom:
in the center of the middle mortar, fix a
fire-pump or brilliant fountain, which
must be open at bottom, and long enough
to project out of the mouth of the mortar;
then paste paper on the tops of all
the mortars.</p>

<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a><span class="pageno">124</span>
<p>Mortars thus prepared are called a
nest of serpents, as represented by <a href="#illo3">Fig.
31</a>. When you would fire these mortars,
light the fire-pump C, which
when consumed will communicate to all
the mortars at once, by means of the
leaders. For mortars of six, eight, or
ten inches diameter, the serpents should
be made in one and two ounce cases, six
or seven inches long, and fired by a
leader, brought out of the mouth of
the mortar, and turned down the outside,
and the end of it covered with paper, to
prevent the sparks of the other works
from setting it on fire. For a six inch
mortar, let the quantity of powder for
firing be two ounces; for an eight inch,
two ounces and three quarters; and for
a ten inch, three ounces and three quarters;
care must be taken in these as well
as small mortars, not to put the serpents
in too tight, for fear of bursting the
mortars. These sort of mortars may be
loaded with stars, crackers, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>If the mortars, when loaded, are to
be sent any distance, or liable to be much
moved, the firing powder should be secured
from getting amongst the serpents,
which would endanger the mortars, as
<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a><span class="pageno">125</span>
well as hurt their performance; to prevent
which, load your mortars after this
manner; first put in the firing powder
and spread it equally about; then cut
a round piece of blue touch-paper,
equal to the exterior diameter of the
mortar, and draw on it a circle, equal
to the interior diameter of the mortar,
and notch it all round as far as that circle;
then paste that part which is notched,
and put it down the mortar close to
the powder, and stick the pasted edge
to the mortar; this will keep the powder
always smooth at bottom, so that
it may be moved or carried any where,
without receiving any damage. The
large single mortars are called pots des
aigrettes.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">The Manner of making, loading,
and firing of Pots des Brins.</p>

<p>These pots are made of paste-board,
and must be rolled pretty thick; they
are usually made three or four inches
diameter, and four diameters long, and
pinched with a neck at one end, like
common cases; a number of these are
<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a><span class="pageno">126</span>
placed on a plank in the following manmer:
having fixed on a plank, two
rows of wooden pegs, cut, in the bottom
of the plank, a groove the whole
length under each row of pegs; then,
through the centre of each peg, bore a
hole down to the groove at bottom, and
on every peg fix and glue a pot, whose
mouth must fit tight on the peg; thro’
all the holes run a quick-match, one
end of which must go into the pot, and
the other into the groove, which must
have a match laid in it from end to end,
and covered with paper, so that when
lighted at one end, it may discharge the
whole almost instantaneously: in all the
pots put about one ounce of meal and
corn powder; then in some put stars,
and others rains, snakes, serpents, crackers,
<abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> when they are all loaded, paste
paper over their mouths. Two or three
hundred of these pots being fired together,
make a very pretty show, by affording
so great a variety of fires. <a href="#illo3">Fig.
32</a>, is a range of pots des brins, with
the leader A, by which they are fired.</p>

<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a><span class="pageno">127</span>
<p class="p2 center larger">Of Pots des Saucissons.</p>

<p>Saucissons are generally fired out of
large mortars without chambers, the
same as those for aigrettes, only somewhat
stronger: saucissons are made of
one and two ounce cases, five or six
inches long, and choaked in the same
manner as serpents; half the number
which the mortar contains, must be
drove one diameter and a half with
composition, and the other half two
diameters, so that when fired they may
give two volleys of reports; but if the
mortars be very strong, and will bear a
sufficient charge, to throw the saucissons
very high, you may make three volleys
of reports, by dividing the number of
cases into three parts, and making a difference
in the height of the charge:
after they are filled, pinch and tie them
at top of the charge, almost close; only
leaving a small vent to communicate the
fire to the upper part of the case, which
must be filled with corn powder very
near the top; then pinch the end quite
close, and tie it; after this is done, bind
the case very tight with waxed pack-thread,
<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a><span class="pageno">128</span>
from the choak at top of the
composition, to the end of the case;
this will make the case very strong in
that part, and cause the report to be
very loud: saucissons should be rolled a
little thicker of paper than the common
proportion. When they are to be put
in the mortar, they must be primed in
their mouths, and fired by a case of
brilliant fire, fixed in their center.</p>

<p>The charge for these sort of mortars
should be one sixth, or one eighth, more
than for pots des aigrettes of the same
diameter.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">To fix one Rocket on the Top of
another.</p>

<p>When sky rockets are thus managed,
they are called towering rockets, on
account of their mounting so very high.
Towering rockets are made after this
manner; fix on a pound rocket a head
without a collar; then take a four ounce
rocket, which may be headed or bounced,
and rub the mouth of it with meal
powder wetted with spirit of wine, when
done put it in the head of the large rocket
<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a><span class="pageno">129</span>
with its mouth downwards; but before
you put it in, stick a bit quick-match in
the hole in the clay of the pound rocket,
which match should be long enough
to go a little way up the bore of the
small rocket, in order to fire it, when
the large one is burnt out; the four
ounce rocket being too small to fill the
head of the other, roll round it as much
tow as will make it stand upright in the
center of the head: the rocket being
thus fixed, paste a single paper round the
opening of the top of the head of the
large rocket. The large rocket must
have only half a diameter of charge
rammed above the piercer, for if filled
to the usual height, it would turn before
the small one takes fire, and entirely
destroy the intended effect; when
one rocket is headed with another, there
will be no occasion for any blowing powder;
for the force with which it lets off,
will be sufficient to disingage it from the
head of the first fired rocket. The
sticks for these sort of rockets, must be
a little longer than for those headed with
stars, rains, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a><span class="pageno">130</span>
<p class="p2 center larger">Of Caduceus Rockets.</p>

<p>Caduceus rockets in rising form two
spiral lines, or double worm, by reason
of their being placed obliquely, one opposite
the other; and their counterpoise
in their center, which causes them to
rise in a vertical direction. Rockets for
this purpose, must have their ends choaked
close, without either head or bounce;
for a weight at top, would be a great
obstruction to their mounting; though
I have known them sometimes to be
bounced, but then they did not rise so
high as those that were not, nor do any
Caduceous rockets ascend so high as
single ones; because of their serpentine
motion, and likewise the resistance of
air, which is much greater than two
rockets of the same size would meet
with, if fired singly.</p>

<p>By <a href="#illo3">Fig. 33</a>. you see the method of
fixing these rockets: the sticks for this
purpose, must have all their sides equal,
which sides should be equal to the
breadth of a stick, proper for a sky
rocket of the same weight as those you
intend to use, and to taper downwards
<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a><span class="pageno">131</span>
as usual, long enough to ballance them,
one length of a rocket, from the cross
stick; which must be placed from the
large stick, six diameters of one of the
rockets, and its length seven diameters so
that each rocket when tied on, may form
with the large stick an angle of sixty degrees.
In tying on the rockets, place
their heads on the opposite sides of the
cross stick; and their ends on the opposite
sides of the long stick, then carry a leader
from the mouth of one, into that of the
other. When these rockets are to be
fired, suspend them between two hooks
or nails, then burn the leader through
the middle, and both will take fire at the
same time. Rockets of one pound, are
a good size, for this use.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of Honorary Rockets.</p>

<p>Honorary rockets are the same as sky
rockets, except that they carry no head
nor report, but are closed at top, on
which is fixed a cone, then on the case,
close to the top of the stick, you tie a
two ounce case, about five or six inches
long, filled with a strong charge, and
pinched close at both ends; then in the
<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a><span class="pageno">132</span>
reverse sides at each end, bore a hole,
in the same manner as in Tourbillons;
from each hole, carry a leader, into the
top of the rocket. When the rocket is
fired, and arrived to its proper height,
it will give fire to the case at top, which
will cause both rocket and stick, to spin
very fast, in their return, and represent
a worm of fire, descending to the
ground.</p>

<p>There is another method of placing
the small case, which is by letting the
stick rise a little above the top of the
rocket, and tying the case to it, so as to
rest on the rocket: these sort of rockets
have no cones.</p>

<p>There is also a third method, by
which these kind of rockets are managed,
which is thus: In the top of the
rocket fix a piece of wood, in which
drive a small iron spindle, then make a
hole in the middle of the small case,
through which put the spindle; then
fix on the top of it a nut, to keep the
case from falling off; when this is done,
the case will turn very fast, without the
rocket: but this method does not answer
so well, as either of the former.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">To divide the Tail of a Sky
Rocket, so as to form an Arch
when ascending.</p>

<p>Having some rockets made, and headed
according to fancy, and tied on their
sticks; get some sheet tin, and cut it
into round pieces, about three or four
inches diameter, then on the stick of
each rocket, under the mouth of the
case, fix one of these pieces of tin; sixteen
inches from the rockets neck, and
support it by a wooden bracket, as strong
as possible: the use of this, is, that when
the rocket is ascending, the fire will play
with great force on the tin, which will
divide the tail in such a manner, that
it will form an arch, as it mounts, (and
will have a very good effect if well managed)
if there be a short piece of port-fire,
of a strong charge, tied to the end of
the stick, it will make a great addition;
but this must be lighted, before you
fire the rocket.</p>

<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a><span class="pageno">134</span>
<p class="p2 center larger">To make several Sky Rockets,
rise together, in the same direction,
and equally distant from
each other.</p>

<p>Take six or any number of sky rockets,
of what size you please; then cut
some strong pack-thread, into pieces of
three or four yards long, and tie each
end of these pieces to a rocket in this
manner. Having tied one end of your
pack-thread, round the body, of one
rocket, and the other end to another;
take a second piece of pack-thread and
make one end of it fast to one of the
rockets already tied, and the other end
to a third rocket, so that all the rockets
except the two outside ones will be fastened
to two pieces of pack-thread;
the length of thread, from one rocket
to the other, may be what the maker
pleases; but the rockets must be all of
a size, and their heads filled with the
same weight of stars, rains, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>Having thus done, fix in the mouth
of each rocket, a leader of the same
length; and, when you are going to
<a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a><span class="pageno">135</span>
fire them, hang them almost close together,
then tie the ends of the leaders
together, and prime them; this prime
being fired, all the rockets will mount
at the same time, and divide themselves
as far as the firings will allow; which
division they will keep, provided they
are all rammed alike, and well made.
These sort of rockets, are called by some,
chained-rockets.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of Signal Sky Rockets.</p>

<p>Signal-rockets are made of several
sorts, according to the different signals
intended to be given: but in Artificial
Fireworks, two sorts are only made
use of, which are one with reports, and
the other without any thing, except the
charge; but those for the use of the
Navy and Army, are headed with stars,
serpents, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>&mdash;&mdash;&#8203;Rockets which are
to be bounced, must have their cases
made one and a half or two diameters
longer, than the common proportion,
and after they are filled, drive in a double
quantity of clay, then bounce and
pinch them, after the usual manner, and
fix on each a cap.</p>

<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a><span class="pageno">136</span>
<p>Signal sky rockets without bounces,
are nothing more than common sky
rockets, closed and caped: rockets of
this sort are very light, therefore do not
require such heavy sticks as those with
loaded heads, for which reason, you
may cut one length of the rocket, off
the stick, or else make them thinner.</p>

<p>Signal rockets with reports, are sometimes
fired in small flights, and often
both these and those without reports,
are used, for a signal, to begin firing a
collection of works; and occasionally,
for many other purposes.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">How to fix two or more Sky Rockets
on one stick.</p>

<p>Two, three, or six sky rockets, fixed
on one stick, and fired together, make
a grand and beautiful appearance; for
the tails of all will seem but as one of
an immense size, and the breaking of so
many heads at once, will resemble the
bursting of an air ballóón; but the management
of this device, requires a
skilful hand; therefore for the encouragement
of those who are fond of curious
performances, I shall give such instructions,
<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a><span class="pageno">137</span>
that, if well observed, even
by those who have not made a great progress
in this art, there will be no doubt,
of the rockets having the desired effect.</p>

<p>Rockets for this purpose, must be
made with the greatest exactness, all
rammed by the same hand, in the same
mould, and out of the one proportion
of composition; and after they are filled
and headed, must all be of the same
weight; the stick must also be well
made, (and proportioned) according to
the following directions: first supposing
your rockets to be half pounders,
whose sticks are six feet six inches long,
then if two, three, or six of these are
to be fixed on one stick, let the length
of it, be nine feet nine inches, then cut
the top of it, into as many sides, as there
are rockets, and let the length of each
side be equal to the length of one
of the rockets without its head; and in
each side, cut a groove (as usual,) then
from the grooves, plane it round, down
to the bottom, where its thickness must
be equal to half the top of the round
part. As the thickness of these sort of
sticks, cannot be exactly ascertained, I
shall give a rule which generally answers,
for any number of rockets above two:
<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a><span class="pageno">138</span>
the rule is this; that the stick at top,
must be thick enough when the grooves
are cut, for all the rockets to lay, without
pressing each other, though as near
together as possible.</p>

<p>When only two rockets, are to be
fixed on one stick, let the length of the
stick be, according to the last given proportion,
but shaped after the common
method, and the breadth and thickness,
double the dimensions, given in the table
page, 94. The point of poise,
must be in the usual place, (let the number
of rockets be what they will): if
sticks made by the above directions,
should be too heavy, plane them thinner;
and if too light, make them thicker;
but always make them of the same
length.</p>

<p>When more than two rockets, are
tied on one stick, there will be some
danger, of their flying up without the
stick, unless the following precaution
be taken, for cases being placed on all
sides, there can be no notches, for the
cord which ties on the rockets, to lay
in; therefore instead of notches, drive a
small nail, in each side of the stick, between
the necks of the cases; and let the
cord which goes round their necks, be
<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a><span class="pageno">139</span>
brought close under the nails; by this
means, the rockets will be as secure,
as when tied on singly. Your rockets
being thus fixed, carry a quick-match
without a pipe, from the mouth of one
rocket to the other; this match being
lighted will give fire to all the rockets
at once.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the directions already
given, may be sufficient, for the
management of those sort of rockets; I
shall here add an improvment, of my
own, on a very essential part of this device,
which is, that of hanging the
rockets, to be fired; for before I hit
upon the following method, many of my
essays, proved unsuccessful; but to prevent
such perplexities, instead of the old
and common manner of hanging them on
nails or hooks, make use of this contrivance,
have a ring made of strong
iron wire, large enough for the stick to
go in, as far as the mouths of the rockets,
then let this ring be supported by a
small iron, at some distance, from the
post or stand, to which it is fixed; then
have another ring, fit to receive and
guide the small end of the stick; rockets
thus suspended will have nothing to
obstruct their fire; but when they are
<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a><span class="pageno">140</span>
hung on nails or hooks, in such a manner,
that some of their mouths, are
against or upon a rail, there can be no
certainty of their rising, in a vertical
direction.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of Sky Rockets without sticks.</p>

<p>To fire rockets without sticks, you
must have a stand made in this manner;
get a block of wood, one foot diameter
or there abouts, and make the bottom
of it flat, so that it may stand steady;
in the center of the top of this block,
draw a circle two inches and a half diameter,
and divide the circumference of
it into three equal parts; then take three
pieces of thick iron wire, each about
three feet in length, and drive them into
the block, one at each point made on
the circle; when these wires, are drove
in, deep enough to hold them fast, and
upright, so that the distance from one to
the other, be the same at top, as at bottom,
the stand is compleat.</p>

<p>The stand being thus made, prepare
your rockets after the following method;
take some common sky rockets, of any
size, and head them as you please, then
<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a><span class="pageno">141</span>
get some balls of lead, and tie to each a
small wire, two, or two feet and a half
long, and the other end of each wire,
tie to the neck of a rocket; these balls
answer the purpose of sticks, when made
of a proper weight, which is about
two thirds the weight of the rocket; but
when they are of a proper size, they
will ballance the rocket in the same manner
as a stick, at the usual point of poize.
To fire these sort of rockets, hang them,
one at a time, between the tops of the
wires, letting their heads rest on the
points of the wires, and the balls hang
down between them; if the wires
should be too wide, for the rockets,
press them together, till they sit, and if
too close, force them open: the wires
for this purpose, must be softened, so
as not to have any spring, or they will not
keep their position, when pressed close
or opened.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of Rain-falls for Sky Rockets,
Double and Single.</p>

<p>Gold and silver rain composition, are
drove in cases, that are pinched quite
close at one end; if you roll them dry,
<a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a><span class="pageno">142</span>
four or five rounds of paper will be
strong enough, but if the are pasted,
three rounds will do, and the thin sort
of cartridge paper is best for those small
cases; which in rolling you must not
turn down the inside edge, as in other
cases, for a double edge would be too
thick for so small a bore; the moulds
for rain falls, should be made of brass,
and turned very smooth in the inside; or
the cases, which are so very thin, would
tear in coming out, for the charge must
be drove in tight; and the better the case
sits the mould, the more driving it will
bare. These moulds have no nipple, but
instead of which they are made flat; as
it would be very tedious and troublesome,
to shake the composition out of
such small ladles, as are used for these
cases; it will be necessary to have a funnel
made of thin tin, to fit on the top
of the case, by the help of which you
may fill them very fast; for single rain
falls for four ounce rockets, let the diameter
of the former be two sixteenths
of an inch, and the length of the case
two inches; for eight ounce rockets,
four sixteenths, and two diameters of
the rocket long; for one pound rocket
five sixteenths, and two diameters of the
<a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a><span class="pageno">143</span>
rocket long; for two pound rockets,
five sixteenths, and three inches a half
long; for four pound rockets, six sixteenths,
and four inches and a half long;
and for six pounders, seven sixteenths
diameter, and five inches long.</p>

<p>Of double rain falls, there are two
sorts; as for example, some appear first
like a star, and then as rain; and some
appear first as rain and then like a star:
when you would have stars first; you
must fill the cases within half an inch
of the top, with rain composition, and
the remainder with star composition;
but when you intend the rain should be
first, drive the case half an inch with
star composition, and the rest with rain.
By this method, may be made many
changes of fire; for in large rockets,
you may make them first burn as stars,
then rain, and then again as stars, or
they may first shew rain, then stars, and
afterwards finish with a report, but
when they are thus managed, cut open
the first rammed end, after they are filled
and bounced, at which place prime
them; the star composition for this purpose
must be a little stronger than for
rolled stars.</p>

<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a><span class="pageno">144</span>
<p class="p2 center larger">Of Strung Stars.</p>

<p>First take some thin paper, and cut it
into pieces of an inch and a half square, or
therabouts, then on each piece lay as much
dry star composition as you think the
paper will easily contain; then twist up
the paper as tight as you can; when done,
rub some past on your hands, and roll
the stars between them, then set them
to dry; your stars being thus made, get
some flax or fine tow, and roll a little of
it over each star, then paste your hands
and roll the stars as before, and set them
again to dry; when they are quite dry,
with a piercer, make a hole through the
middle of each, into which run a cotton
quick-match, long enough to hold, ten
or twelve stars, at three or four inches
from one another: but any number of
stars may be strung together by joining
the match.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of Tailed Stars.</p>

<p>Those sort of stars are called tailed
stars, because there are a great number
of sparks issue from them, which represent
<a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a><span class="pageno">145</span>
a tail like that of a comet; of
those stars there are two sorts, which
are rolled, and drove; when they are
rolled they must be moistened, with a
liquor made of half a pint of spirit of
wine, and half a gil of thin size, of this
as much as will wet the composition
enough, to make it roll easy; when they
are rolled, sift meal powder over them,
and set them to dry.</p>

<p>When tailed stars are drove, the
composition must be moistened with spirit
of wine only, and not made so wet
as for rolling; one and two ounce cases
rolled dry, are best for this purpose;
and when they are filled, unroll the case
within three or four rounds of the charge,
and all that you unroll cut off, then paste
down the loose edge; two or three days
after the cases are filled, cut them in
pieces five or six eighths of an inch in
length, then melt some wax, and dip
one end of each piece into it, so as to
cover the composition; the other end
must be rubbed with meal powder wetted
with spirit of wine.</p>

<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a><span class="pageno">146</span>
<p class="p2 center larger">Of Drove Stars.</p>

<p>Cases for drove stars, are rolled with
paste, but are made very thin of paper;
before you begin to fill them, damp the
composition, with spirit of wine that
has had some camphor dissolved in it;
you may ram them indifferently hard,
so that you do not break, or sack the
case, and to prevent which they should
fit tight in the mould: they are drove in
cases of several sizes, from eight drams
to four ounces; when they are filled in
half ounce cases, cut them in pieces, of
three quarters of an inch in length; if
one ounce cases, cut them in pieces of
one inch; if two ounce cases, cut them
in pieces of one inch and a quarter in
length, and if four ounce cases, cut
them in pieces one inch and a half in
length; having cut your stars of a proper
size, prime them at both ends, with
wet meal powder; stars of this sort are
seldom put in rockets, they being chiefly
intended for air ballóóns, and drove in
cases, to prevent the composition from
being broke by the force of the blowing
powder in the shell.</p>

<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a><span class="pageno">147</span>
<p class="p2 center larger">Of Rolled Stars.</p>

<p>Rolled stars are commonly made about
the size of a musket ball, though
they are rolled of several sizes, from the
bigness of a pistol ball, to one inch diameter;
and sometimes they are made
very small, but then they are called
sparks; great care must be taken in making
of stars, first, that the several ingredients
be reduced to a fine powder; secondly,
that the composition be well
worked and mixed together. Before you
begin to roll, take about a pound of
composition, and wet it with the following
liquid, enough to make it stick together
and roll easy; spirit of wine, one
quart, in which dissolve a quarter of an
ounce of isinglass; if a great quantity of
composition be wetted at once, the spirit,
will evaporate, and leave it dry, before
you can roll it into stars; having rolled
up one proportion, shake the stars in
meal powder, and set them to dry,
which they will do in three or four days.
But if you should want them for immediate
use, dry them in an earthen pan
over a slow heat, or, in an oven: it being
<a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a><span class="pageno">148</span>
very difficult to make the stars all of an
equal size, when the composition is taken
up promiscuously with the fingers;
therefore I shall here set down a method
by which you may make them very
exact, which is thus: When the mixture
is moistened properly, roll it on a flat
smooth stone, and cut it into square
pieces, making each square, large enough
for the stars you intend; there is
another method used by some to make
stars, which is by rolling the composition,
in long pieces, and then cutting
off the star, so that each star will be of
a cylindrical form; but this method is
not so good as the former, for to make
the composition roll this way, it must
be made very wet, which makes the
stars heavy as well as weaken them.
All stars must be kept as much from
air, as possible, otherwise they will grow
weak and bad.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of Scrolls for Sky Rockets.</p>

<p>Cases for scrolls, should be made four
or five inches in length, and their interior
diameter three eighths of an inch;
one end of these cases must be pinched
<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a><span class="pageno">149</span>
quite close, before you begin to fill, and
and when filled, close the other end,
then in the opposite sides make a small
hole at each end, to the composition, in
the same manner as in Tourbillons; and
prime them with wet meal powder: you
may put in the head of a rocket, as many
of these cases as it will contain; these
cases being fired turn very quick in the
air, and form a scroll or spiral line.
They are generally filled with a strong
charge, as that of serpents, or brilliant
fire.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of Swarmers or small Rockets.</p>

<p>Rockets which go under the denomination
of swarmers, are those from
two ounces downards. These small rockets
are fired sometimes, in flights, and
in large water-works, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> Swarmers of
one and two ounces, are bored, and made
in the same manner as large rockets, except
when headed, their heads must be
put on without a collar; the number of
strokes, for driving one ounce rockets,
must be eight; and for two ounce rockets,
twelve.</p>

<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a><span class="pageno">150</span>
<p>All rockets under one ounce, are not
bored, but must be filled to the usual
height, with composition, which is generally
composed, of fine meal prowder
four ounces, and charcoal or steel dust
two drams; the number of strokes for
ramming these small swarmers, is not
very material, so as they are rammed
true, and moderately hard. The necks
of unbored rockets, must be in the same
proportion, as in common cases.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of the cause of sky Rockets rising.</p>

<p>Having promised
in the second
section, to prove
that the effect of
sky rockets, and
proportion of
their charge, depends
on the size
of the cavity in
the composition;
I shall here endeavour
to give
a mathematical
demonstration
thereof.</p>

<p>Let ABC be the hollow cone for the
fire, AYCZB, the superficies of that
cone, all the lines OZ at right angles
with BC, all the lines OY at right angles
with AC: now all the angles ZOY
being towards R, whether the angles ZOY
are obtuse or acute, but the more acute
the better. The rays of fire ZO and
YO issuing from the sides of the cone
BC and AC, and continually acting
with the greater force one upon another
at O, forcing the whole BCA upward
from the point R; and the wider the
cone is, (so as not to exceed one third at
bottom, and one sixth at top, of the exterior
diameter of the rocket,) the greater
velocity will the rocket rise with.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of Stands for Sky Rockets.</p>

<p>Care must be taken, in placing the
rockets, when they are to be fired, in
order to give them a vertical direction at
their first setting out; which may be
managed thus. Have two rails of wood,
of any length, supported, at each end, by
a perpendicular leg, so that the rails be
horizontal, and let the distance from one
to the other, be almost equal to the
<a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a><span class="pageno">152</span>
length of the sticks of the rockets, intended
to be fired; then in the front of
the top rail, drive square hooks at eight
inches distance from one another, with
their points turning sideways, so that
when the rockets are hung on them, the
points will be before the sticks, and keep
them from falling, or being blown off by
the wind; in the front of the rail at bottom,
must be staples, drove perpendicular
under the hooks at top; through
these staples, put the small ends of the
rocket sticks. Rockets are fired by applying
a lighted port fire, to their
mouths.</p>

<p class="hanging">N. B. When sky rockets are made to
perfection, and fired, they will stand
two or three seconds on the hook before
they rise, and then mount up briskly,
with a steady motion, carrying a large
tail from the ground all the way up,
and just as they turn, break and disperse
the stars.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of Girandole Chests, for flights
of Rockets.</p>

<p>Girandole chests, are generally composed
of four sides, of equal dimensions,
<a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a><span class="pageno">153</span>
but may be made of any diameter, according
to the number of rockets, designed
to be fired; its height must be in
proportion to the rockets, but must always
be a little higher than the rockets,
with their sticks; when the sides are
joined, six in the top, as far down the
chest as the length of one of the rockets
with its cap on. In this top, make as
many square or round holes, to recieve
the rocket sticks, as you intend to have
rockets, but let the distance between
them, be sufficient for the rockets to
stand without touching one another;
then from one hole to another, cut a
groove, large enough for a quick-match
to lay in: the top being thus fixed, put
in the bottom, at about one foot and a
half distance from the bottom of the
chest; in this bottom must be as many
holes, as in the top, and all to correspond,
but these holes need not be so large, as
those in the top.</p>

<p>To prepare your chest, you must lay
a quick-match, in all the grooves, from
hole to hole; then take some sky rockets,
and rub them in the mouth, with wet
meal powder, and put a bit of match up
the cavity of each, which match, must
be long enough, to hang, a little below
<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a><span class="pageno">154</span>
the mouth of the rocket; your rockets
and chest being prepared, according to
the above directions, put the sticks of
the rockets, through the holes in the
top and bottom of the chest, so that
their mouths may rest on the quick-match
in the grooves; by which all the
rockets, will be fired at once; for by giving
fire to any part of the match, it will
communicate to all the rockets, in an
instant. As it would be rather troublesome,
to direct the sticks from the top,
to the proper holes in the bottom, it will
be necessary to have a small door in one
of the sides, which when opened, you
may see how to place the sticks. Flights
of rockets, being seldom fired at the
beginning of any fireworks, for which
reason, they are in danger of being fired,
by the sparks from wheels, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> Therefore
to preserve them, a cover should be
made to sit on the chest, and the door
in the side kept shut.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of Serpents or Snakes for Pots des
Aigrettes, Small Mortars, Sky

<p>Serpents for this use, are made from
two inches and an half, to seven inches
in length, and their formers from
three sixteenths, to five eights of an inch
diameter, but the diameter of the cases,
must always be equal to two diameters
of the former: they are rolled and choaked
like other cases, and filled with
composition from five eights of an inch,
to one inch and an half high, according
to the size of the mortars, or rockets,
they are designed for, and the remainder
of the cases, bounced with corn-powder,
and afterwards their ends
pinched and tied close: before they are
used their mouths must be primed with
wet meal-powder.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of Leaders, or Pipes of Communication.</p>

<p>The best paper for leaders, is a large
sort of white paper, called Elephant,
<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a><span class="pageno">156</span>
which you cut into long slips, two or
three inches broad, so that they may go
three or four times round the former,
(but not more) for when they are very
thick, they are too strong for the paper
which fastens them to the works, and
will sometimes fly off, without leading
the fire: the formers for these leaders,
are made from two, to six sixteenths of
an inch diameter, but four sixteenths is
the size generally made use of; the formers
are made of smooth brass wire;
when you use them, rub them over with
grease, or keep them wet with paste, to
prevent their sticking to the paper,
which must be pasted all over; in rolling
of pipes, make use of a rolling
board, but use it lightly; having rolled a
pipe, draw out the former with one
hand, holding the pipe, as light as possible
with the other, for if it press against
the former, it will stick and tear
the paper.</p>

<p class="hanging">N. B. Make your leaders of different
lengths, or in cloathing of works, you
will cut a great many to waste. Leaders
for marron Batteries must be made
of strong cartrige paper.</p>

<hr />
<p class="p2 center larger">Of Aquatick Fireworks.</p>

<p class="dropcap negindent">A<span class="sc ls">ll</span> works that shew themselves
in the water, are much admired
by most people who are fond of fireworks,
particularly water rockets; but
as these seem of a very extraordinary nature
to those who are acquainted with
this art, I shall endeavour to explain
the method of making them, in as full
and easy a manner as possible, as well as
other devices for the water.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of Water Rockets.</p>

<p>Water rockets may be made from
four ounces, to two pound, but if larger
they are too heavy, so that it will be
<a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a><span class="pageno">158</span>
difficult to make them keep above waters
without a cork float, which must be
tied to the neck of the case, but the
rockets will not dive so well with, as
without floats.</p>

<p>Cases for water rockets, are made in
the same manner and proportion as sky
rockets, only a little thicker of paper;
when you fill these rockets which are
drove solid, put in first, one ladle full of
slow fire, then two of the proper charge,
and on that one or two ladles of sinking
charge, then the proper charge, then the
sinking charge again, and so on, till you
have filled the case within three diameters;
then drive on the composition, one
ladle full of clay, through which make a
small hole to the charge, then fill the
case, within half a diameter with corn
powder, on which turn down two or
three rounds of the case in the inside,
then pinch and tie the end very tight;
having filled your rockets, (according to
the above directions) dip their ends in
melted rosin, or sealing wax, or else
secure them well with grease. When
you fire these rockets, throw in six, or
eight at a time; but if you would have
them all sink, or swim, at the same
time, you must drive them with an equal
<a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a><span class="pageno">159</span>
quantity of composition, and fire
them all together.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">To make Pipes of Communication,
which may be used under
Water.</p>

<p>Pipes for this purpose, must be a little
thicker of paper, than those for land
works; having rolled a sufficient number
of pipes, and kept them till thoroughly
dry, wash them over with drying
oil, and set them to dry; but when
you oil them, leave about an inch and
a half, at each end dry, for joints; for
if they were oiled all over, when you
come to join them, the paste would not
stick, where the paper is greasy; after
the leaders are joined, and the paste dry,
oil the joints. These sort of pipes will
lay many hours under water, without receiving
any damage.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of Horizontal Wheels for the
Water.</p>

<p>First get a large wooden bowl without
a handle, then have an octogon wheel
<a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a><span class="pageno">160</span>
made of a flat board, eighteen inches diameter,
so that the length of each side
will be near seven inches; in all the sides
cut a groove for the cases to lie in, this
wheel being made, nail it on the top of
the bowl, then take eight four ounce cases,
filled with a proper charge, each about
six inches in length. Now to
cloath the wheel with these cases, get
some whitish-brown paper, and cut it
into slips, four or five inches broad, and
seven or eight long, these slips being pasted
all over on one side, take one of the
cases, and roll one of the slips of paper,
about an inch and a half on its end, so
that there will remain about two inches
and a half of the paper hollow from the
end of the case, this case tie on one of
the sides of the wheel, near the corners
of which, must be holes bored, through
which you put the pack-thread to tie
the cases; having tied on the first case at
the neck and end, put a little meal-powder
in the hollow paper, then paste a slip
of paper on the end of another case, the
head of which put into the hollow paper
on the first, allowing a sufficient distance
from the tail of one, to the head of
the other, for the pasted paper, to bend
without tearing; the second case tie on
<a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a><span class="pageno">161</span>
as you did the first, and so on with the
rest, except the last, which must be closed
at the end, unless it is to communicate
to any thing on top of the wheel;
such as fire-pumps or brilliant fires, fixed
in holes, cut in the wheel, and fired
by the last or second case, as the fancy
directs: six, eight, or any number may
be placed on the top of the wheel, so that
they are not too heavy for the bowl.</p>

<p>Before you tie on the cases cut the upper
part of all their ends, except the
last, a little shelving, that the fire from
one, may play over the other, without
being obstructed by the case. Wheel
cases, have no clay drove in their ends
nor pinched, but are always left open,
only the last, or those which are not to
lead fire, which must be well secured.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of Mines for the Water.</p>

<p>For these sort of mines you must have
a bowl, with a wheel on it, made in the
same manner, as the water wheel, only
in the middle of the wheel must be a
hole, of the same diameter you design to
have the mine; those mines are nothing
more than a tin pot, with a strong bottom,
<a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a><span class="pageno">162</span>
and a little more than two diameters
in length; your mine must be fixed
in the hole in the wheel, with its bottom
resting on the bowl; then loaded
with serpents, crackers, stars, small water
rockets, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> In the same manner
as pots des aigrettes, but in their center,
fix a case of Chinese fire, or a small
gerbe, which must be lighted at the
beginning of the last case on the wheel.
These sort of wheels are to be cloathed
as usual.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of Fire Globes for the Water.</p>

<p>Bowls for water globes, must be very
large, and the wheels on them of a decagon
form, on each side of which nail
a piece of wood four inches long, and on
the outside of each piece cut a groove,
wide enough to receive about one fourth
of the thickness of a four ounce case;
these pieces of wood must be nailed, in
the middle of each face of the wheel,
and fixed in an oblique direction, so that
the fire from the cases may incline upwards;
the wheel being thus prepared,
tie in each groove a four ounce case, fill’d
with a grey charge, then carry a leader
<a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a><span class="pageno">163</span>
from the tail of one case to the mouth
of the other.</p>

<p>Globes for these wheels, are made
of two tin hoops, with their edges outwards,
fixed one within the other, at
right angles. The diameter of these hoops
must be somewhat less than that of the
wheel. Having made a globe, drive in the
center of a wheel, an iron spindle,
which must stand perpendicular, and its
length, four or six inches more than the
diameter of the globe.</p>

<p>This spindle serves for an axis, on
which the globe is fixed, which, when
done, must stand four or six inches from
the wheel; round one side of each hoop,
must be soldered, little bits of tin, two
inches and a half distance from each other,
which pieces must be two inches
in length each, and only fastened at one
end, the other ends being left loose, to
turn round the small port fires and hold
them on: these port fires must be made
of such a length, as will last out the cases
on the wheel. You are to observe
that there need not be any port fires, at
the bottom of the globe within four inches
of the spindle, for if there were,
they would have no effect, but only
burn the wheel; all the port fires, must
<a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a><span class="pageno">164</span>
be placed perpendicular from the center
of the globe, with their mouths outwards;
and must all be cloathed with
leaders, so as all to take fire with the second
case of the wheel; which cases
must burn two at a time, one opposite
the other. When two cases of a wheel
begin together, two will end together;
therefore the two opposite end cases, must
have their ends pinched and secured
from fire. The method of firing wheels
of this sort, is, by carrying a leader from
the mouth, of one of the first cases, to
that of the other, which leader being
burnt through the middle, will give fire
to both at the same time.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of Odoriferous Water Ballóóns.</p>

<p>These sort of Ballóóns, are made in
the same manner, as air Ballóóns, but
very thin of paper, and in diameter one
inch and three quarters, with a vent of
half an inch diameter. The shells being
made, and quite dry, fill them with any
of the following compositions, which
must be rammed in tight: these sort of
Ballóóns, must be fired at the vent, and
put into a bowl of water. Odoriferous
works, are generally fired in rooms.</p>

<p class="hanging">N. B. Water rockets, may be made
with any of the above compositions,
with a little alteration, to make them
weaker, or stronger, according to the
size of the cases.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of Water Ballóóns.</p>

<p>Having made some thin paper shells,
of what diameter you please, fill some
with the composition for water ballóóns,
and some after this manner. Having
made the vent of the shells pretty large,
fill them almost full with water rockets,
marrons, squibs, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> Then put in some
blowing powder, sufficient to burst the
shells, and afterwards fix in the vent a
water rocket, long enough to reach the
bottom of the shell, and its neck to project
<a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a><span class="pageno">167</span>
a little out of the vent; this rocket
must be open at the end, in order to
fire the powder in the shell, which will
burst the shell, and disperse the small
rockets, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> in the water. When you
have well secured the large rocket, in the
vent of the shell; take a cork float, with
a hole in its middle, which fit over the
head of the rocket, and fasten it to the
shell: this float, must be large enough
to keep the ballóón above water.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of water Squibs.</p>

<p>Water squibs, are generally made of
one ounce serpent cases, seven or eight
inches long, filled two thirds with
charge, and the remainder bounced;
the common method of firing them, is
thus: Take a water wheel, with a tin
mortar in its center, which load with
squibs, after the usual method, but the
powder in the mortar, must be no more
than will just throw the squibs out, (easily
into the water), you may place the
cases on the wheel, either obliquely, or
horizontally; and on the top of the
wheel, round the mortar, fix six cases of
brilliant fire, perpendicular to the wheel;
<a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a><span class="pageno">168</span>
these cases, must be fired, at the beginning
of the last case of the wheels and
the mortar, at the conclusion of the same.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">To represent a sea fight with small
ships, and to prepare a fire-ship
for the same.</p>

<p>Having procured four, or five, small
ships, of two, or three feet in lenghth,
(or as many as you design to fight) make
a number of small reports, which are to
serve for guns. Of these, range as many
as you please, on each side of the upper
decks; then at the head and stern of each
ship, fix a two ounce case, eight inches
long, filled with a slow port-fire receipt,
but take care to place it, in such a manner,
that the fire may fall in the water,
and not burn the rigging; in these cases,
bore holes at unequal distances, from
one another, but make as many in each
case, as half the number of reports, so
that one case may fire the guns, on one
side, and the other those on the opposite.
The method of firing the guns, is, by carrying
a leader, from the holes in the cases,
to the reports on the decks; you
<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a><span class="pageno">169</span>
must make these leaders very small, and
be careful in calculating the burning
of the slow fire, in the regulating cases,
that more than two guns, be not fired at
a time. When you would have a broad-side
given, let a leader be carried to a
cracker, placed on the outside of the
ship, which cracker must be tied loose,
or the reports will be too slow; in all
the ships put artificial guns, at the
port holes.</p>

<p>Having filled, and bored holes, in two
port fires, for regulating the guns, in
one ship; make all the rest exactly the
same; then when you begin the engagement,
light one ship first, and set it a
sailing, and so on with the rest, sending
them out singly, which will make them
fire regularly, at different times, without
confusion, for the time between the
firing of each gun, will be equal to that
of lighting the slow fires.</p>

<p>The fire ship, may be of any size, and
need not be very good, for it is always
lost in the action. To prepare a ship for
this purpose, make a port fire equal in
size, with them in the other ships, and
place it at the stern; in every port, place
a large port fire, filled with a very strong
composition, and painted in imitation of
<a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a><span class="pageno">170</span>
a gun, and let them all be fired at once
by a leader from the slow fire, within two,
or three diameters of its bottom; all along
both sides, on the top of the upper
deck, lay star composition about half an
inch in thickness, and one in breadth,
which must be wetted with thin size,
then primed with meal powder, and secured
from fire, by pasting paper over it;
in the place where you lay this composition,
drive some little tacks with flat
heads, in order to hold it fast to the
deck, this must be fired just after the
sham guns, and when burning will shew
a flame all round the ship; at the head
take up the decks, and put in a tin mortar
loaded with crackers, which mortar
must be fired by a pipe, from the end of
the slow fire; the firing of this mortar
will sink the ship, and make a pretty
conclusion. The regulating port fire of
this ship, must be lighted at the same
time, with the first fighting ship.</p>

<p>Having prepared all the ships for fighting;
we shall next proceed with the management
of them, when on the water.
At one end of the pond, just under the
surface of the water, fix two running
blocks, at what distance you chuse the
<a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a><span class="pageno">171</span>
ships should fight; and at the other end
of the pond, opposite to each of these
blocks, under the water, fix a double
block; then on the land, by each of the
double blocks, place two small windlass’s;
round one of them, turn one end
of a small cord, and the other end, put
through one of the blocks; then carry it
through the single one, at the opposite
end of the pond, and bring it back
through the double block, again, and,
round the other windlass; to this cord,
near the double block, tie as many small
strings, as half the number of the ships,
at what distance you think proper, but
these strings, must not be more than
two feet in length each; the loose end
of each of these cords, make fast, to a
ship, just under her bow-sprit; but if
tied to the keel, or too near the water,
it will overset the ship. Half the ships,
being thus prepared, near the other
double block, fix two more windlass’s,
to which fasten a cord, and to it tie the
other half of the ships, as before directed:
when you fire the ships, pull in the
cord, with one of the windlass’s, in order
to get all the ships together; and
when you have set fire to the first, turn
that windlass, which draws them out,
<a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a><span class="pageno">172</span>
and so on with the rest, till they are all
out, in the middle of the pond; then by
turning the other windlass, you will
draw them back again, by which method
you may make them change sides,
and tack about, backwards and forwards,
at pleasure. For the fire-ship, fix the
blocks and windlass’s, betwixt the others,
so that when she sails out, she will be
between the other ships: you must not
let this ship, advance, till the guns, at
her ports take fire.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">To fire Sky Rockets under water.</p>

<p>To fire sky rockets, under water, you
must have stands made as usual, only the
rails must be placed flat, instead of edge
ways, and have holes in them for the
rocket sticks to go through; for if they
were hung upon hooks, the motion of
the water, would throw them off;
the stands being made, if the pond is
deep enough, sink them at the sides, so
deep, that when the rockets are in, their
heads, may just appear above the surface
of the water; to the mouth of each rocket,
fix a leader, which put through the
hole with the stick; then a little above
<a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a><span class="pageno">173</span>
the water, must be a board, supported
by the stand, and placed along one side
of the rockets, then the ends of the leaders,
are turned up through holes made
in this board, exactly opposite the rockets.
By this means, you may fire them
singly, or all at once. Rockets may be
fired by this method, in the middle of a
pond, by a Neptune, a swan, a water
wheel, or any thing else you
chuse.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">To represent Neptune in his
Chariot.</p>

<p>In order to represent this, to perfection,
you must have a Neptune made
(of wood, or basket work), as big as
life, fixed on a float, large enough to
bear his weight; on which must be two
horses heads, and necks, so as to seem
swiming, as they are shown by <a href="#illo3">Fig. 35</a>.
For the wheels of the chariot, there
must be two vertical wheels, of black
fire, and on Neptune’s head a horizontal
wheel, of brilliant fire, with all its cases
to play upwards. When this wheel is
made, cover it with paper, or, paste
board, cut and painted like Neptune’s
<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a><span class="pageno">174</span>
coronet; then let the trident be made
without prongs, but instead of them,
fix three cases of a weak grey charge,
and on each horse’s head, put an eight
ounce case of brilliant fire, and on the
mouth of each, fix a short case of the
same diameter, filled with the white
flame receipt, enough to last out all the
cases on the wheels; these short cases
must be open at bottom, that they may
light the brilliant fires; for the horses
eyes, put small port fires, and in each
nostril, put a small case filled half with
grey charge, and the rest with port fire
composition.</p>

<p>If Neptune is to give fire, to any building
on the water; at his first setting out,
the wheels of the chariot, and that on
his head, together with the white flames
on the horses head, and the port fires in
their eyes and nostrils, must all be lighted
at once; then from the bottom of the
white flames, carry a leader, to the trident.
As Neptune is to advance by the
help of a block and cord, you must manage
it so as not to let him turn about,
till the brilliant fires on the horses, and
the trident, begins, for it is by the fire
from the horses, (which plays almost
upright) that the building, or work, is
<a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a><span class="pageno">175</span>
lighted; which must be thus prepared.
From the mouth of the case, which is to
be first fired, hang some loose quick
match, to receive the fire from the horses.
When Neptune, is only to be shewn
by himself, without setting fire to any other
works; let the white flames on the
horses, be very short, and not to last
longer than one case of each wheel,
and let two cases of each wheel burn at
a time.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">To represent Swans and Ducks in
the water.</p>

<p>If you would have the swans, or
ducks, discharge rockets into the water,
they must be made hollow, and of paper,
and filled with small water rockets,
with some blowing powder, to throw
them out; but if this is not done, they
may be made of wood, which will last
many times. Having made and painted
some swans, fix them on floats, then in
the places where their eyes should be,
bore holes, two inches deep, inclining
downwards, and wide enough to receive
a small port fire; the port fire cases for
<a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a><span class="pageno">176</span>
this purpose, must be made of brass, two
inches in length and filled with a slow
bright charge; in the middle of one of
these cases, make a little hole, then put
the port fire, in the eye hole of the swan,
leaving about half an inch to project
out, and in the other eye put another
port fire, with a hole made in it; then in
the neck of the swan, within two inches
of one of the eyes, bore a hole slantways,
to meet that in the port fire; in
this hole put a leader, and carry it to a
water rocket, that must be fixed under
the tail with its mouth upwards; on
the top of the head, place two one ounce
cases, four inches in length each, drove
with brilliant fire; one of these cases
must incline forwards, and the other
backwards; these must be lighted at the
same time as the water rocket; to do
which, bore a hole between them, in
the top of the swans head, down to
the hole in the port fire, to which carry
a leader; if the swan be filled with
rockets, they must be fired, by a pipe,
from the end of the water rocket under
the tail. When you set the swan a
swiming light the two eyes.</p>

<a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a><span class="pageno">177</span>
<p class="p2 center larger">Of fire Fountains for the Water.</p>

<p>To make a fire fountain, you must
first have a float made of wood, three
feet diameter, then in the middle of it,
fix a round perpendicular post, four feet
in height, and two inches diameter;
round this post, fix three circular
wheels, made of thin wood, without any
spokes. The largest of these wheels
must be placed, within two, or three inches
of the float, and must be nearly of
the same diameter. The second wheel
must be two foot two inches diameter,
and fixed at two feet distance from
the first wheel. The third wheel must
be one foot four inches diameter, and
fixed within six inches of the top of the
post: the wheels being fixed, take eighteen
four, or eight ounce cases, of brilliant
fire, and place them round the
first wheel, with their mouths outwards,
and inclining downwards; on
the second wheel place, thirteen cases
of the same sort, and in the same manner,
as those on the first wheel; on
the third wheel, place eight more of
this sort of cases, in the same manner
<a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a><span class="pageno">178</span>
as before, and on the top of the post,
fix a gerbe, then cloath all the cases,
with leaders, so that both they and the
gerbe may take fire at the same
time. Before you fire this work, try
it in the water, to see if the float be
properly made, so as to keep the fountain
upright.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">To make Crackers.</p>

<p class="dropcap negindent">C<span class="sc ls">ut</span> some cartridge paper, into
pieces, three inches and a half
broad, and one foot long; one edge of
each of these pieces, fold down lengthwise
about three quarters of an inch
broad; then fold the double edge down
a quarter of an inch, and turn the single
edge back half over the double fold; then
open it, and lay all along the channel
which is formed, by the folding of the
paper, some meal powder, then fold it
over and over, till all the paper is doubled
up, rubbing it down every turn;
this being done, bend it backwards and
forwards, two inches and a half, or
thereabouts, at a time, as often as the paper
will allow; then hold all these folds
<a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a><span class="pageno">180</span>
flat and close, and with a small pinching
cord, give one turn round the middle of
the cracker, and pinch it close, then bind
it with pack-thread, as tight as you can
then in the place where it was pinched,
prime one end of it, and cap it with
touch paper. When these crackers are
fired they will give a report, at every
turn of the paper: if you would have a
great number of bounces, you must cut
the paper longer, or join them after they
are made; but if they are made very
long before they are pinched, you must
have a piece of wood, with a groove in
it, deep enough to let in half the cracker,
this will hold it straight, while it is
pinching. <a href="#illo3">Fig. 36.</a> represents a cracker
compleat.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of Single Reports.</p>

<p>Cases for reports are generally rolled
on one and two ounce formers, and are
seldom made larger, but on particular occasions;
they are made from two, to four
inches long, and very thick of paper;
having rolled a case, pinch one end quite
close, and drive it down, then fill the
case with corn powder, only leaving
<a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a><span class="pageno">181</span>
room to pinch it at top, but before you
pinch it, put in a piece of paper at top
of the powder: Reports are fired, by a
vent, bored in the middle, or at one
end, just as required.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of Marrons.</p>

<p>Formers for marrons, are from three
quarters of an inch, to one and a half
diameter; cut the paper for the cases,
twice the diameter of the former broad,
and long enough to go three times
round; when you have rolled a case,
paste down the edge, and tie one end
close, then with the former drive it
down to take away the wrinkles and
make it flat at bottom, then fill the case
with corn powder one diameter and a
quarter high, and fold down the rest of
the case tight on the powder; the marron
being thus made, wax some strong
pack-thread, with shoemakers wax; this
thread wind up in a ball, then unwind
two, or three yards of it, and that part
which is near the ball, make fast to a
hook; then take a marron, and stand as
far from the hook as the pack-thread
will reach, and wind it lengthwise round
<a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a><span class="pageno">182</span>
marron, as close as you can, till it will
hold no more that way; then turn it,
and wind the pack-thread on the short
way, then lengthwise again, and so on
till the paper is all covered; then make
fast the end of the pack-thread, and beat
down both ends of the marron, to
bring it in shape. The method of firing
marrons, is by making a hole at
one end with an awl and putting in a
piece of quick-match, then take a piece
of strong paper, in which wrap up the
marron, with two leaders, which must
be put down to the vent, and the paper
tied tight round them with small twine;
these leaders are bent on each side, and
their loose ends tied to other marrons,
and are nailed in the middle to the rail
of the stand, as may be seen by <a href="#illo3">Fig. 37.</a>
The use of winding the pack-thread in
a ball, is, that you may let it out as
you want it, according to the quantity,
the marron may require; and that it may
not be tied in knots, which would spoil
the marron.</p>

<a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a><span class="pageno">183</span>
<p class="p2 center larger">Of Marron Batteries.</p>

<p>Those batteries, if well managed, will
keep time to a march, or a slow piece of
musick. Marron batteries are made of
several stands, with a number of cross
rails, for the marrons, which are regulated
by leaders, by cutting them of different
lengths, and nailing them tight, or
loose, according to the time of the musick.
In marron batteries you must use
the large and small sort of marrons, and
the nails for the pipes, must have flat
heads.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of Line Rockets.</p>

<p>Line rockets are made and drove in
the same manner as sky rockets, but
have no heads, and the cases must be cut
close to the clay; they are sometmies
made with six, or seven changes, but in
general not more than four, or five; the
method of managing those rockets, is as
follows; first have a piece of light wood,
the length of one of the rockets, turned
round about two inches and a half
diameter, with a hole through the middle
<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a><span class="pageno">184</span>
lengthwise, large enough for the
line to go easily through; if you design
four changes, have four grooves cut in
the swivel, one opposite the other, to lay
the rockets in.</p>

<p>The mouths of the rockets being rubbed
with wet meal powder, lay them in
the grooves, head to tail, and tie them
fast; from the tail of the first rocket,
carry a leader to the mouth of the second,
and from the second to the third, and so
on to as many as there are on the swivel,
making every leader very secure, but in
fixing these pipes take care, that the
quick-match does not enter the bores of
the rockets; the rockets being fixed on
the swivel, and ready to be fired, have a
line of a hundred yards in length, stretched
and fixed up tight, at any height
from the ground, but be sure to place it
horizontal; this length of line will do
for rockets of half a pound, but if larger,
the line must be longer, before you put
up the line, put one end of it through
the swivel, and when you fire the line
rocket, let the mouth of that rocket
which you fire first, face that end of the
line where you stand, then the first rocket
will carry the rest to the other end of
the line, and the second will bring them
<a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a><span class="pageno">185</span>
back again, and so they will run out and
in according to the number of rockets:
at each end of the line, there must be a
piece of flat wood, for the rocket to
strike against, or its force would cut the
line. Let the line be well soaped, and
the hole in the swivel very smooth.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of the different Decorations for
Line Rockets.</p>

<p>To line rockets may be fixed many
sorts of things, such as flying dragons,
mercuries, ships, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> Or they may be
made to run on the line like a wheel,
which is done in this manner; have a
flat swivel, made very exact, and on it,
tie two rockets obliquely, one on each
side, which will make it turn round all
the way it goes, and form a circle of
fire; the charge for these rockets, should
be a little weaker than common; if you
would shew two dragons fighting, get
two swivels made square, and on each
tie three rockets together, on the under
side; then have two flying dragons made
of tin, and fix one of them on the top
of each swivel, so as to stand upright; in
the mouth of each dragon put a small
<a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a><span class="pageno">186</span>
case of common fire, and another at the
end of the tail; you may put two or
three port fires of a strong charge, on one
side of their bodies, in order to shew
them. This being done put them on the
line, one at each end; but let there be a
swivel in the middle, of the line, to keep
the dragons from striking together; before
you fire the rockets light the cases
on the dragons, and if care be taken in
firing both at the same time, they will
meet in the middle of the line, and seem
to fight. Then they will run back, and
return again, with great violence, which
will have a very pleasing effect. The line
for these rockets must be very long, or
they will strike too hard together.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of Chinese Flyers.</p>

<p>Cases for flyers, may be made of different
sizes, from one to eight ounces;
they must be made thick of paper, and
eight interior diameters long; they are
rolled in the same manner as tourbillons,
with a straight pasted edge, and pinched
close at one end; the method of filling
them is thus; the case being put in a
mould, whose cylinder, or foot, must be
<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a><span class="pageno">187</span>
flat at top, without a nipple; fill it within
half a diameter of the middle, then
ram in half a diameter of clay, and on
that as much composition as before, on
which drive half a diameter of clay,
then pinch the case close, and drive it
down flat; after this is done, bore a hole,
exactly through the center of the clay in
the middle, then in the opposite sides at
both ends make a vent, and in that side
you intend to fire first make a small hole
to the composition near the clay in the
middle, from which carry a quick match
covered with a single paper, to the vent
at the other end; then when the charge
is burnt on one side, it will, by means
of the quick match communicate to the
charge in the other, (which may be of a
different sort). The flyers being thus made,
put an iron pin, that must be fixed in
the work on which they are to be fired,
and on which they are to run; through
the hole in the middle, on the end of
this pin, must be a nut to keep the flyer
from running off. If you would have
them turn back again after they are
burnt; make both the vents at the ends
on the same side, which will alter its
course, the contrary way.</p>

<a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a><span class="pageno">188</span>
<p class="p2 center larger">Of Table Rockets.</p>

<p>Table rockets are designed merely to
shew the truth of driving, and the judgment
of a fireworker, they having no other
effect, when fired, than spinning
round in the same place, where they begin;
till they are burnt out, and shewing
nothing more than an horizontal circle
of fire.</p>

<p>The method of making these sort of
rockets, is as follows: Have a cone turned
out of hard wood, two inches and a
half diameter, and as much in height;
round the base of it draw a line, on this
line fix four spokes, two inches in length
each, so as to stand one opposite the other;
then fill four nine inch one pound
cases, with any strong composition,
within two inches of the top, these cases
are made like tourbillons, and must
be rammed with the greatest exactness.</p>

<p>Your rockets being filled, fix their
open ends on the short spokes, then in
the side of each case bore a hole near
the clay; all these holes, or vents, must
be made in such a manner, that the fire
<a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a><span class="pageno">189</span>
of each case may act the same way;
from these vents carry leaders to the
top of the cone, and tie them together.
When you would fire the rockets set
them on a smooth table, and light the
leaders in the middle, and all the cases
will fire together (See <a href="#illo3">fig. 38.</a>) and
spin on the point of the cone.</p>

<p>These rockets may be made to rise
like tourbillons, by making the cases
shorter, and boring four holes in the
under side of each at equal distances
from one another: this being done they
are called double tourbillons.</p>

<p class="hanging">Note, all the vents in the under side
of the cases must be lighted at once;
and the sharp point of the cone cut off,
at which place make it spherical.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">To make Wheels and other Works
incombustible.</p>

<p>It being necessary, when your works
are new, to paint them of some dark colour;
therefore, if instead of which, you
make use of the following composition,
it will give them a good colour, and in a
great measure prevent their taking fire
so soon, as if painted. Take brick-dust,
<a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a><span class="pageno">190</span>
coal ashes, and iron filings, of each an equal
quantity, and mix them together,
with a double size, made hot. With this
wash over your works, and when dry
wash them over again; this will preserve
the wood greatly against fire. Let the
brick-dust, and ashes, be beat to a fine
powder.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of Single Vertical Wheels.</p>

<p>There are different sorts of vertical
wheels, some having their fells of a circular
form, others of an hexagon, octagon,
or decagon form, or any number of
sides, according to the length of the cases,
you design for the wheel: your
spokes being fixed in the nave, nail slips
of tin, with their edges turned up, so
as to form grooves for the cases to ly
in, from the end of one spoke to another;
then tie your cases in the grooves,
head to tail, in the same manner as those
on the horizontal water wheel, so that
the cases successively taking fire from
one another, will keep the wheel in an
equal rotation. Two of these wheels are
very often fired together, one on each
side of a building, and both lighted at
<a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a><span class="pageno">191</span>
the same time, and all the cases filled
alike, to make them keep time together,
which they will do if made by
the following directions. In all the cases
of both wheels, except the first, on each
wheel, drive two, or three ladles full of
slow fire, in any part of the cases, but
be carefull to ram the same quantity in
each case, and in the end of one of the
cases, on each wheel, you may ram one
ladle full of dead fire composition,
which must be very lightly drove; you
may also make many changes of fire, by
this method.</p>

<p>Let the hole in the nave of the wheel
be lined with brass, and made to turn on
a smooth iron spindle. On the end of this
spindle let there be a nut, to screw off
and on; when you have put the wheel
on the spindle, screw on the nut, which
will keep the wheel from flying off.
Let the mouth of the first case be a
little raised. See <a href="#illo3">fig. 39.</a> Vertical wheels
are made from ten inches to three feet
diameter, and the size of the cases must
differ accordingly; four ounce cases,
will do for wheels, of fourteen, or sixteen
inches diameter, which is the proportion
generally used. The best wood
for wheels of all sorts, is a light, and
dry beech.</p>

<a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a><span class="pageno">192</span>
<p class="p2 center larger">Of Horizontal Wheels.</p>

<p>Horizontal wheels are best when
their fells are made circular; in the
middle of the top of the nave, must be
a pintle, turned out of the same piece as
the nave, two inches long, and equal in
diameter to the bore of one of the cases
of the wheel; there must be a hole bored
up the center of the nave, within
half an inch of the top of the pintle;
the wheel being made, nail at the end
of each spoke (of which there should be
six or eight) a piece of wood, with a
groove cut in it to receive the case. These
pieces fix in such a manner, that half
the cases may incline upwards, and half
downwards, and that when they are tied
on, their heads and tails may come very
near together; from the tail of one case,
to the mouth of the other carry a leader,
which secure with pasted paper. Besides
these pipes, it will be necessary, to put a
little meal powder inside the pasted paper,
in order to blow off the pipe, that
there may be no obstruction to the fire,
from the cases. By means of these pipes,
the cases, will successively take, burning
<a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a><span class="pageno">193</span>
one upwards, and the other downwards.
On the pintle, fix a case of the
same sort as those on the wheel; this
case must be fired by a leader, from the
mouth of the last case on the wheel,
which case must play downwards: instead
of a common case in the middle,
you may put a case of Chinese fire, long
enough, to burn as long as two or three
of the cases on the wheel.</p>

<p>Horizontal wheels are often fired two
at a time, and made to keep time, like
vertical wheels, only they are made
without any slow or dead fire; ten or
twelve inches will be enough for the diameter
of wheels, with six spokes. <a href="#illo3">Fig.
40.</a> represents a wheel on fire, with the
first case burning.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of Spirali Wheels.</p>

<p>Spirali wheels are nothing more than
double horizontal wheels, and are thus
made: The nave must be about six inches
long, and somewhat thicker than the single
sort; instead of the pintle at top,
there must be a hole for the case to be
fixed in; there must also be two sets
of spokes, one set near the top of the
<a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a><span class="pageno">194</span>
nave, and the other near the bottom. At
the end of each spoke cut a groove,
wherein you tie the cases, there being no
fell; the spokes should not be more than
three inches and a half in length each
from the nave, so that the wheel may
not be more than eight or nine inches
diameter; the cases are placed in such a
manner, that those at top play down, and
those at bottom to play up, but let the
third or fourth case play horizontally.
The case in the middle may begin with
any of the others, you please; six spokes
will be enough for each set, so that the
wheel may consist of twelve cases, besides
that on the top: the cases for these
sort of wheels need not be more than six
inches in length each.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of Plural Wheels.</p>

<p>Plural wheels are made to turn horizontally,
and to consist of three sets of
spokes, placed in the following manner,
six at top, six at bottom, and four in the
middle, which must be a little shorter
than the rest; let the diameter of the
wheel be ten inches; the cases must be
tied on the ends of the spokes, in grooves
<a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a><span class="pageno">195</span>
cut on purpose, or in pieces of wood,
nailed on the ends of the spokes, with
grooves cut in them as usual; in cloathing
these wheels, make the upper set of
cases play obliquely downwards, and
them at bottom obliquely upwards, and
them in the middle horizontally. In
placing the leaders, you must order it so
that the cases may burn thus: viz. first
up, then down, then horizontal, and so
on with the rest, but another change
may be made, by driving in the end of
the eighth case, two, or three ladles full
of slow fire, to burn till the wheel has
stopped its course; then let the other cases
be fixed the contrary way, which will
make the wheel run back again: for the
case at top, you may put a small gerbe;
and let the cases on the spokes be short,
and filled with a strong brilliant charge.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of the Illuminated Spiral Wheel.</p>

<p>First have a circular horizontal wheel
made two feet diameter, with a hole
quite through the nave; then take three
thin pieces of deal, three feet in length
each, and three quarters of an inch in
breadth each; one end of each of these
<a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a><span class="pageno">196</span>
pieces, nail to the fell of the wheel, at
an equal distance from one another, and
the other ends nail to a block with a
hole in its bottom, which must be perpendicular,
with that in the block of the
wheel, but not so large. The wheel being
thus made, have a hoop planed down
very thin and flat, then nail one end of
it to the fell of the wheel, and wind it
round the three sticks in a spiral line,
from the wheel to the block at top; on
the top of this block fix a case of Chinese
fire; on the wheel you may place
any number of cases, which must incline
downwards and burn two at a time. If
the wheel should consist of ten cases, you
may let the illuminations and Chinese
fire begin with the second cases; the
spindle for this wheel must be a little
longer than the cone, and made very
smooth at top, on which the upper
block is to turn, and the whole weight
of the wheel to rest, see <a href="#illo3">fig. 41.</a></p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of the Double Spiral Wheel.</p>

<p>For this wheel, the block, or nave,
must be as long as the height of the
worms, or spiral lines, but must be made
<a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a><span class="pageno">197</span>
very thin, and as light as possible. In
this block must be fixed several spokes,
which must diminish in length, from the
wheel to the top, so as not to exceed the
surface of a cone of the same height. To
the ends of these spokes nail the worms,
which must cross each other several
times; these worms cloath with illuminations,
the same as those on the single
wheels, but the horizontal wheel, you
may cloath as you like. At top of the
worm, place a case of spur-fire, or an
amber light, see <a href="#illo3">fig. 42.</a> This figure is
shewn without leaders, to prevent a confusion
of lines.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of Ballóón Wheels.</p>

<p>Ballóón wheels are made to turn horizontally,
they must be made two feet
diameter, without any spokes, and very
strong, with any number of sides. On
the top of a wheel range and fix tin
pots, three inches diameter and seven
inches in height each, as many of these
as there are cases on the wheel; near the
bottom of each pot, make a small vent,
into each of these vents carry a leader
from the tail of each case; some of the
<a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a><span class="pageno">198</span>
pots load with stars, and some with serpents,
crackers, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> As the wheels
turn, the pots will successively be fired,
and throw into the air a great variety of
fires.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of Fruiloni Wheels.</p>

<p>First have a nave made nine inches in
length, and three in diameter, near the
bottom of this nave fix eight spokes,
with a hole in the end of each large enough
to receive a two, or four ounce
case. Each of these spokes may be fourteen
inches in length from the block;
near the top of this block, fix eight
more, of the same sort of spokes, exactly
over the others, but not so long by
two inches; as this wheel is to run horizontally,
all the cases in the spokes, at
top, must play obliquely upwards, and
all them in the spokes at bottom obliquely
downwards. This being done, have a
small horizontal wheel made with eight
spokes, each five inches in length from
the block; on the top of this wheel,
place a case of brilliant fire; all the cases
on this wheel must play in an oblique
direction downwards, and burn two at a
<a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a><span class="pageno">199</span>
time, and those on the large wheel, four
at a time, that is, two of those in the top
set of spokes, and two of them in the
bottom set of spokes.</p>

<p>The four first cases on the large
wheel, and the two first on the small
wheel, must be fired at the same time,
and the brilliant fire at top, at the beginning
of the last cases. The cases of
the wheels may be filled with a grey
charge; when these wheels are compleated,
you must have a strong iron
spindle, made four feet six in length,
and fixed perpendicular on the top of a
stand; on this put the large wheel,
whose nave must have a hole quite
through from the bottom to the top.
This hole must be large enough to turn
easy round the bottom of the spindle,
at which place there must be a shoulder,
to keep the wheel from touching
the stand; at the top of the spindle, put
the small wheel, and join it to a large
one with a leader, in order to fire them
both together.</p>

<a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a><span class="pageno">200</span>
<p class="p2 center larger">Of Port fires for Illuminations.</p>

<p>These sort of port fires, have their cases
made very thin of paper, and rolled
on formers, from two to five eighths of
an inch diameter, and are made from
two, to six inches in length; they are
pinched close at one end, and left open
at the other; when you fill them, put
in but a little composition at a time,
and ram it in lightly, so as not to break
the case. Three or four rounds of paper,
with the last round pasted, will be strong
enough for these sort of cases.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of Common port fires.</p>

<p>Common port fires are intended purposely
to fire the works, their fire being
very slow, and the heat of the flame so
intense, that, if applyed to rockets, leaders,
<abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, it will fire them immediately.
Port fires may be made of any length,
but are seldom made more than twenty
one inches in length; the interior diameter
of port fire moulds, should be ten
sixteenths of an inch, and the diameter
of the former, half an inch. The cases
<a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a><span class="pageno">201</span>
must be rolled wet with paste, and one
end of them pinched, or folded down.
The moulds should be made of brass,
and to take in two pieces lengthwise;
then when the case is in the two sides,
they are held together by brass rings, or
hoops, which are made to fit over the
outside. The bore of the mould must
not be made quite through, so that there
will be no occasion for a foot. Those
port fires when used, are held in copper
sockets, fixed on the end of a long
stick; these sockets are made like port
crayons, only with a screw, instead of a
ring.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of Cascades of Fire.</p>

<p>Cascades are made of any size, but
one made according to the dimensions
of that shewn in <a href="#illo4">plate 4.</a> fig. 43. will
be large enough for eight ounce cases.
Let the distance from A to B, be three
feet; from B to C, two feet six inches;
and from C D, two feet; and let the
cross piece, at A, be four feet in length;
then from each end of this piece, draw
a line to D; then make the other cross
pieces of such a length as to come
<a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a><span class="pageno">202</span>
within those lines. The top piece D,
may be of any length so as to hold the
cases, at a little distance from one another,
all the cross pieces are fixed horizontally,
and supported by brackets; the
bottom cross piece should be about one
foot six inches broad in the middle, the
second one foot, the third nine inches,
and the top piece four inches; the cases
may be made of any length, but must
be filled with a brilliant charge; on the
edges of the cross pieces must be nailed
bits of wood, with a groove cut in
each piece, large enough, for a case
to lie in, These bits of wood are fixed
so as to incline downwards, and that
the fire from one teer of cases may play
over the other; all the cases being tied
fast on, carry leaders from one to the
other, and let there be a pipe, hang
from the mouth of one of the cases,
covered at the end with a single paper,
which you burn to fire the cascade.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of the Fire-Tree.</p>

<p>To make a fire-tree, as shewn by <a href="#illo4">fig.
44.</a> you must first have a piece of wood
six feet in length, and three inches
<a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a><span class="pageno">203</span>
square, then at E, nine inches from the
top, make a hole in the front, and in
each side, or instead of holes you may
fix short pegs, to fit the inside of the
cases. At F, nine inches from E, fix
three more pegs; at G, one foot nine
inches from F, fix three pegs; at H,
nine inches from G, at I, nine inches from H, fix three pegs, inclining
downwards, but all the other
pegs, must incline upwards, in order
that the cases may have the same inclination
as you see in the figure; then
at top place a four inch mortar, loaded
with stars, rains, or crackers. In the
middle of this mortar, place a case filled
with any sort of charge, but let it be
fired with the other cases: a brilliant
charge will do for all the cases, but the
mortar may be made of any diameter,
and the tree of any size, and on it any
number of cases, provided they are placed
in the manner described.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of Chinese Fountains.</p>

<p>To make a Chinese fountain, you
must have a perpendicular piece of
wood, seven feet in length, and two
inches and a half square. Sixteen inches
<a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a><span class="pageno">204</span>
from the top; fix on the front, a cross
piece, one inch thick, and two and a
half broad, with the broad side upwards;
below this, fix three more pieces,
of the same width and thickness, at
sixteen inches distance from each other;
let the bottom rail be five feet in
length, and the others of such a length,
as to allow the fire pumps to stand in
the middle of the intervals of each other.
The pyramid being thus made,
fix in the holes made in the bottom
rail, five fire pumps, at equal distances;
on the second rail place four
pumps; on the third, three; on the
fourth, two; and on the top of the
post, one; but place them all to incline
a little forwards, that when they
throw out the stars, they may not strike
against the cross rails; having fixed
your fire pumps, cloath them with leaders,
so that they may all be fired together,
see <a href="#illo4">fig. 45.</a></p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of Illuminated Globes with Horizontal
Wheels.</p>

<p>The hoops for these sort of globes,
may be made of wood, tin, or iron
wire, about two feet diameter; for
a single globe take two hoops, and
fasten them together, one within the
other at right angles; then have a horizontal
wheel made, whose diameter
must be a little wider than the globe,
and its nave six inches long, on the
top of which the globe is fixed, so as to
stand three or four inches from the
wheel; on this wheel you may put
any number of cases, fill’d with what
charge you like, but let two of them
burn at a time; they may be placed
horizontally or to incline downwards
just as you chuse. Now when the
wheel is cloathed, fix on the hoops
as many illuminations as will stand
within two inches and a half of one
another; these you fasten on the
hoops, with small iron binding wire,
and when they are all on, put on
your pipes of communication, which
must be so managed, as to light
<a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a><span class="pageno">206</span>
them all with the second or third
case on the wheel; the spindle on
which the globe is to run must go
through the block of the wheel,
up to the inside of the top of the
globe, where must be fix’d a bit of
brass or iron, with a hole in it to
receive the point of the spindle,
on which the whole weight of the
wheel is to bear, as is shewn by
<a href="#illo4">fig. 46.</a> which represents a globe on
its spindle. By this method may be
made a crown, which is done by
having the hoops bent in the form
of a crown. Sometimes globes and
crowns, are ordered so as to stand
still, and the wheel only to turn
round; but when you would have the
globe or crown to stand still, and the
wheel to run by itself, the block of
the wheel must not be so long, nor
the spindle any longer than to just
raise the globe a little above the
wheel; and the wheel cases, and the
illumination must begin together.</p>

<a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a><span class="pageno">207</span>
<p class="p2 center larger">Of the Dodecaedron.</p>

<p>This piece is called a dodecaedron,
because it nearly represents a twelve sided
figure, and is made thus. First have
a ball turned out of some hard wood,
fourteen inches diameter, when done,
divide its surface into fourteen equal
parts, from which bore holes, one inch
and a half diameter, perpendicular to
the center, so that they may all meet
exactly in the middle; then let there
be turned in the inside of each hole a
female screw, and to all the holes but
one, must be made a round spoke, five
feet in length, with four inches of the
screw at one end, to fit the holes;
then in the screw end of all the spokes,
bore a hole, five inches up, which
must be bored slanting, so as to come
out at one side, a little above the
screw; from which cut a small groove
along the spoke, within six inches of
the other end, where you make another
hole through to the other side of
the spoke; in this end fix a spindle, on
which put a small wheel, of three, or
four sides, each side six or seven inches
<a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a><span class="pageno">208</span>
in length; these sides must have grooves
cut in them large enough to receive a
two or four ounce case; when these
wheels are cloathed, put them on the
spindles, and at the end of each spindle,
put a nut to keep the wheel from falling
off; the wheels being thus fixed, carry a
pipe from the mouth of the first case on
each wheel, through the hole in the side
of the spoke, and from thence along the
groove and through the other hole, so
as to hang out at the screw end, about an
inch. The spokes being all prepared in
this manner, you must have a post, on
which you intend to fire the work, with
an iron screw in the top of it, to fit one
of the holes, in the ball; on this screw
fix the ball, then in the top hole of the
ball, put a little meal powder, and some
loose quick match; then screw in all the
spokes, and in one side of the ball bore a
hole, in which put a leader, and secure
it at the end, and your work will be
ready to be fired. By this leader the
powder and match in the center is fired,
which will light the match at the ends
of the spokes, all at once, whereby all
the wheels will be lighted at one and the
same time; there may be an addition to
this piece, by fixing a small globe, on
<a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a><span class="pageno">209</span>
each wheel, or one on the top wheel only.
A grey charge will be proper for
the wheel cases.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of the Yew Tree of Brilliant Fire.</p>

<p>A yew tree of fire is represented by
<a href="#illo4">fig. 47.</a> as it appears when burning;
first, let A be an upright piece of wood,
four feet in length, two inches broad
and one thick; at top of this piece, on
the flat side, fix a hoop, fourteen inches
diameter, and round its edge and front
place illuminations, and in the center a
five pointed star; then at E, which is
one foot and a half from the edge of the
hoop, place two cases of brilliant fire,
one on each side; these cases should be
one foot in length each; below these,
fix two more cases of the same size, and
at such a distance that their mouths
may almost meet them at top; then,
close to the ends of these cases, fix two
more of the same sort of cases; these
must stand parallel to them at E. The
cases being thus fixed, cloath them with
leaders; so that they, with the illuminations
and star at top, may all take fire
together.</p>

with cases, from one ounce to one
pound, but in general are made with
four ounce cases, four or five inches in

with which it is to burn; at top of the
charge drive some clay; for, as the ends
of these cases are seldom punched, they
would be liable to take fire. Having
filled a case, divide the circumference of
it at the pinched end close to the clay
into five equal parts; then bore five
holes with a gimblet about the size of
the neck of a common four ounce case
into the composition; from one hole to
the other, carry a quick match, and
<a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a><span class="pageno">211</span>
secure it with paper; this paper must
be put on in the manner of that on the
ends of wheel cases, so that the hollow
part, which projects from the end of the
case, may serve to receive a leader from
any other work, in order to give fire to
the points of the star. These sort of
stars may be made with any number of
points.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of the Fixed Sun with a Transparent
Face.</p>

<p>To make a sun of the best sort, there
should be two rows of cases, as in <a href="#illo4">fig.
48</a>, which will shew a double glory,
and make the rays strong and full; the
frame or sun wheel, must be made after
the following manner; have a circular
flat nave made very strong, twelve
inches diameter; to this fix six strong
flat spokes, A, B, C, D, E, F. On the
front of these fix a circular fell, five feet
diameter. Within which fix another
fell, the length of one of the sun cases
less in diameter; within this fix a third
fell, whose diameter must be less than
the second, by the length of one case
and one third; the wheel being made,
<a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a><span class="pageno">212</span>
divide the fells into as many equal parts
as you would have cases (which may be
done from twenty four, to forty four;)
at each division, fix a flat iron staple;
these staples must be made to fit the
cases, so as to hold them fast on the
wheel; let the staples be so placed, that
one row of cases may lay in the middle
of the intervals of the other.</p>

<p>In the center of the block of the
sun, drive a spindle, on which put a
small hexagon wheel, whose cases must
be filled with the same charge, as the cases
of the sun; two cases of this wheel must
burn at a time, and begin with them on
the fells; having fixed on all the cases,
carry pipes of communication from one
to the other, as you see in the figure,
and from one side of the sun to the
wheel in the middle, and from thence
to the other side of the sun. These
leaders will hold the wheel steady while
the sun is fixing up, and will also be a
sure method of lighting both cases of
the wheel together. A sun thus made is
called a brilliant sun, because the wood
work is entirely covered with fire from
the wheel in the middle, so that there
appears nothing but sparks of brilliant
fire; but if you would have a transparent
<a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a><span class="pageno">213</span>
face in the center, you must have
one made of paste board, of any size;
the method of making a face is, by
cutting out the eyes, nose, and mouth,
for the sparks of the wheel to appear
through; but, instead of this sort of
face, you may have one painted on oiled
paper, or Persian silk, strained tight
on a hoop, which hoop must be supported
by three or four pieces of wire,
at six inches distance from the wheel in
the center, so that the light of it may illuminate
the face; by this method you may
have in the front of a sun Vivat rex,
cut in paste board, or Apollo painted on
silk, but for a small collection of fire-works,
a sun with a single glory, and a
wheel in front, will be most suitable.
Half pound cases, filled ten inches with
composition, will be a good size for a
sun of five feet diameter; but if larger,
the cases must be greater in proportion.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of three Vertical Wheels Illuminated,
which turn on their
own Naves upon a Horizontal
Table.</p>

<p>A plan of this is shewn by <a href="#illo4">fig. 49.</a>
Let D be a deal table three feet six
inches diameter; this table must be fixed
horizontally on the top of a post; on
the top of this post must be a perpendicular
iron spindle, which must come
through the center of the table; then
let A, B, C, be three spokes joined to a
triangular flat piece of wood, in the
middle of which make a hole to fit easily
over the spindle; let E, F, G, be pieces
of wood, four or five inches in length
each, and two inches square, fixed on
the under sides of the spokes; in these
pieces make holes lengthwise to receive
the thin part of the blocks of the
wheels, which when in, are prevented
from coming out by a small iron pin
being run through the end of each;
K, L, M, are three vertical octagon
wheels, eighteen inches diameter each;
the blocks of these wheels must be long
<a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a><span class="pageno">215</span>
enough for three or four inches to rest
on the table, round which part drive a
number of sharp points of wire, which
must not project out of the blocks more
than one sixteenth of an inch; the use
of these points is, that when the blocks
run round, they will stick in the table,
and help the wheels forward; if the
naves be made of strong wood, one inch
will be enough for the diameter of the
thin part, which should be made to
turn easy in the holes in the pieces
E, F, G. On the front of the wheels,
make four or five circles of strong wire,
or flat hoops, and tie on them as many
illuminations as they will hold at two
inches from one another; instead of circles,
you may make spiral lines cloathed
with illuminations at the same distance
from one another, as those on the hoops:
when illuminations are fixed on a spiral
line in the front of a wheel, they must
be placed a little on the slant, the contrary
way that the wheel runs: the cases
for these wheels may be filled with any
coloured charge, but must burn only one
at a time.</p>

<p>The wheels being thus prepared, you
must have a globe, crown, or spiral
wheel, to put on the spindle in the middle
<a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a><span class="pageno">216</span>
of the table; this spindle should be
just long enough to raise the wheel of
the globe, crown, or spiral wheel, so
high that its fire may play over the three
vertical wheels; by this means, their
fires will not be confused, nor will the
wheels receive any damage from the
fire of each other; in cloathing this
work, let the leaders be so managed,
that all the wheels may light together,
and the illuminations after two cases of
each wheel are burnt.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of the Illuminated Chandelier.</p>

<p>Illuminated works are much admired
by the Italians, and indeed are a great
addition to a collection of works; for in
a grand exhibition an illuminated piece
should be fired after every two, or three
wheels, or fixed pieces of common and
brilliant fires, and likewise illuminated
works may be made cheap, quick, and
easy.</p>

<p>To make an illuminated chandelier,
you must first have one made of thin
wood; see <a href="#illo4">fig. 50.</a> The chandelier being
made, bore in the front of the
branches, and in the body, and also in
<a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a><span class="pageno">217</span>
the crown at top, as many holes for
illuminations as they will contain, at
three inches distance from each other;
in these holes put illuminations filled
with white, blue, or brilliant charge;
having fixed in the port fires, cloath
them with leaders so that the chandelier
and crown may light together. The
small circles on this figure represent the
mouths of the illuminations, which must
project straight from the front.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of the Illuminated Yew Tree.</p>

<p>First have a tree made of wood, such
as is shewn by <a href="#illo4">fig. 51.</a> The middle
piece or stem, on which the branches
are fixed, must be eight feet six inches
in height; at the bottom of this piece
draw a line, at right angles, two feet six
inches in length at each side; then from
L, which is one foot six inches from
the bottom, draw a line on each side to
C and D; these lines will give the
length of the two first branches. Then
put on the two top branches parallel to
them at bottom; let the length of each
of these branches be one foot from the
stem; from the ends of these two
<a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a><span class="pageno">218</span>
branches, draw a line to C and D; then
fix on five more branches at an equal
distance from each other, and their
length will be determined by the lines
A C and E D; when the branches are
fixed, place illuminating port fires on
the top of each, as many as you chuse:
behind the top of the stem fasten a
gerbe, or white fountain, which must
be fired at the beginning of the illuminations
on the tree.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of Flaming Stars with Brilliant
Wheels.</p>

<p>To make a flaming star, you must first
have made a circular piece of strong
wood, about one inch thick and two
feet diameter; round this block fix
eight points, two feet six inches in
length each; four of these points must
be straight, and four flaming; these
points being joined on very strong and
even with the surface of the block, nail
tin or paste board on their edges, from
the block to the end of each, where
they must be joined; this tin must project
in front eight inches, and be joined
where they meet at the block; round
<a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a><span class="pageno">219</span>
the front of the block fix four pieces of
thick iron wire, eight inches in length
each, equally distant from each other;
this being done, cut a piece of paste
board round two feet diameter, and
draw on it a star, as may be seen in
<a href="#illo4">fig. 52.</a> This star cut out, and on the
back of it paste oiled paper, then paint
each point half red, and half yellow,
lengthwise; but the body of the star
must be left open, wherein must run a
brilliant wheel, which is made as follows:
Have a light block turned nine
inches long; at each end of it, fix six
spokes, at the end of each spoke put a
two ounce case of brilliant fire; the
length of these cases must be in proportion
to the wheel, and the diameter of
the wheel when the cases are on must
be a little less than the diameter of the
body of the small star; the cases on the
spokes in front must have their mouths
incline outwards, and them on the inside
spokes must be placed so as to form
a vertical circle of fire. When you
place your leaders, carry the first pipe
from the tail of one of the cases in front
to the mouth of one of the inside cases,
and from the tail of that to another in
front, and so on to all the cases; your
<a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a><span class="pageno">220</span>
wheel being made, put it on a spindle,
exactly in the center of the star; this
spindle must have a shoulder at bottom,
to keep the wheel at a little distance
from the block. This wheel must be
kept on the spindle by a nut at the end;
having fixed on the wheel, fasten the
transparent star to the four pieces of
wire; then when you fire the wheel,
you will first see nothing more than a
common horizontal wheel; but when
the first case is burnt out, it will fire
one of the vertical cases, which will
shew the transparent star, and fill the
large flames and points with fire; then
it will again appear like a common
wheel, and so on for twelve changes.</p>

<p>Dissolve, in some spirits of wine or

with the above liquor, and when dry it
will be fit for use; when you paste this

<p class="p2 center larger">Of a Projected Regulated Piece of
Nine Mutations.</p>

<p>A regulated piece, if well executed,
is as curious a work as any in fireworks;
for it consists of fixed and moveable
pieces on one spindle, representing various
sorts of figures, which take fire successively
one from another, without any
assistance after lighting the first mutation;
but, for the better explanation of
this piece, I shall give a full description
of the method of communicating the
fire from one mutation to the other,
with a figure of each as they stand on
the spindle. Regulated pieces are made
of many sorts, and of any number of
mutations, from two to nine, which is
the greatest number I ever knew a piece
to consist of, except one of my own
making, which was composed of fifteen
<a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a><span class="pageno">222</span>
mutations, all different fires, and figures.
But, as an explanation of so large a
piece would be very difficult to comprehend,
I shall omit it, leaving so many
changes to those who have made a
great progress in this art, and only
teach the manner of making a piece of
nine mutations, as shewn in <a href="#illo5">Plate <abbr title="Five">V</abbr></a>,
fig. 53. As it will be necessary that
every mutation should be separately explained,
I will first give the name of
each, with the colour of fire, and size
of the case belonging to it: after which
shall proceed, with the proportion of
each mutation, together with the nature
of the spindle, and manner of placing
the leaders.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">First Mutation</p>

<p>Is a hexagon vertical wheel, illuminated
in front with small port fires tied
on the spokes; this wheel must be
cloathed with two ounce cases, filled
with black charge; the length of these
cases are determined by the size of the
wheel, but must burn singly.</p>

<a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a><span class="pageno">223</span>
<p class="p2 center larger">Second Mutation</p>

<p>Is a fixed piece called a golden glory,
by reason of the cases being filled with
spur-fire; the cases must stand perpendicular
to the block on which they are
fixed, so that, when they are burning,
they may represent a glory of fire; this
mutation is generally composed of five,
or seven two ounce cases.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Third Mutation</p>

<p>Is moveable, and is nothing more
then an octagon vertical wheel, cloathed
with four ounce cases, filled with brilliant
charge; two of these cases must
burn at a time: in this wheel you may
make changes of fire.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Fourth Mutation</p>

<p>Is a fixed sun of brilliant fire, consisting
of twelve four ounce cases; the necks
of these cases must be a little larger than
those of four ounce wheel cases; in this
mutation may be made a change of fire,
<a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a><span class="pageno">224</span>
by filling the cases half with brilliant
charge and half with grey.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Fifth Mutation</p>

<p>Is a fixed piece called the porcupine’s
quills; this piece consists of twelve
spokes, standing perpendicular to the
block in which they are fixed; on each
of these spokes, near the end, must be
placed a four ounce case of brilliant fire;
all these cases must incline either to the
right or left, so that they may all play
one way.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Sixth Mutation</p>

<p>Is a standing piece called the cross
fire. This mutation consists of eight
spokes fixed in a block; near the end of
each of those spokes, must be tied two
four ounce cases of white charge, one
across the other, so that the fires from
the cases on one spoke, may intersect
the fire from cases on the other.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Seventh Mutation</p>

<p>Is a fixed wheel, with two circular
fells, on which are placed sixteen eight
<a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a><span class="pageno">225</span>
ounce cases of brilliant fire, in the form
of a star: this piece is called a fixed star
of wild fire.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Eighth Mutation.</p>

<p>This is a beautiful piece, called a brilliant
star piece, it consists of six spokes,
which are strengthened by two fells of
a hexagon form at some distance from
each other; at the end of each spoke,
in the front, is fixed a brilliant star of
five points; and on each side of every
star is placed a four ounce case of black
or grey charge; these cases must be
placed with their mouths side ways, so
that their fires may cross each other.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Ninth Mutation</p>

<p>Is a wheel piece; this is composed of
six long spokes, with a hexagon vertical
wheel at the end of each; these wheels
run on spindles in the front of the
spokes; all the wheels are lighted together:
two ounce cases will do for
these wheels, and may be filled with any
coloured charge.</p>

<a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a><span class="pageno">226</span>
<p>After having spoke of the several parts
of the regulated piece, each by their
proper names and colour of fire, I shall
next proceed with the proportion of
every mutation, together with the method
of conveying the fire from one to
the other, and the distance they stand
one from the other on the spindle.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">First Mutation</p>

<p>Must be a hexagon vertical wheel,
fourteen inches diameter; on one side
of the block, whose diameter is two
inches and a quarter, is fixed a tin barrel
A, see <a href="#illo5">fig. 53</a>, <abbr title="Number">Nᵒ.</abbr> 1; this barrel
must be a little less in diameter than the
nave; let the length of the barrel and
block be six inches. Having fixed the
cases on the wheel, carry a leader from
the tail of the last case into the tin barrel
through a hole made on purpose two
inches from the block; at the end of
this leader let there be about an inch
or two of loose match, but take care to
well secure the hole wherein the pipe
is put, to prevent any sparks falling in,
which would light the second mutation
before its time, and confuse the whole
piece.</p>

<a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a><span class="pageno">227</span>
<p class="p2 center larger">Second Mutation</p>

<p>Is thus made. Have a nave turned two
inches and a half diameter, and three
long; then let half an inch of that end
which faces the first wheel be turned
so as to fit easy into the tin barrel of
the first mutation, which must turn
round it without touching; on the other
end of the block, fix a tin barrel B,
<abbr title="Number">Nᵒ.</abbr> 2, this barrel must be six inches in
length, and only half an inch of it to
fit on the block. Round the nave fix
five spokes, one inch and a half in length
each; the diameter of the spokes must
be equal to a two ounce former; on
these spokes put five seven inch two
ounce cases of spur fire, and carry leaders
from the mouth of one to the other,
that they may all light together; then
from the mouth of one of the cases,
carry a leader, through a hole bored
slantways in the nave, from between
the spokes, to the front of the block
near the spindle hole; the end of this
leader must project out of the hole into
the barrel of the first mutation, so that
when the pipe which comes from the end
of the last case on the first wheel flashes,
<a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a><span class="pageno">228</span>
it may take fire and light the second
mutation. To communicate the fire to
the third mutation bore a hole near the
bottom of one of the five cases, to the
composition, and from thence carry a
leader into a hole made in the middle of
the barrel B; this hole must be covered
with pasted paper.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Third Mutation</p>

<p>May be either an octagon or hexagon
wheel, twenty inches diameter; let the
nave be three inches and a quarter diameter,
and three and a half in length;
one inch and a half of the front of the
nave must be made to fit in the barrel B.
On the other end of the block fix a tin
barrel C, <abbr title="Number">Nᵒ.</abbr> 3; this barrel must be six
inches and a half in length, one inch of
which must fit over the block. The
cases of this wheel must burn two at a
time; and from the mouths of the two
first cases carry a leader, through holes
in the nave into the barrel of the second
mutation, after the usual manner; but
besides these leaders let there be a pipe
go across the wheel from one first case
to the other, then from the tail of one
of the last cases, carry a pipe into a hole
<a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a><span class="pageno">229</span>
in the middle of the barrel C; at the
end of this pipe, let there hang some
loose quick match.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Fourth and Fifth Mutation.</p>

<p>We shall here speak of those two mutations
under one head, as their naves
are made of one piece, which from E
to F is fourteen inches; E, a block four
inches diameter, with ten or twelve
short spokes, on which are fixed eleven
inch eight ounce cases; let the front
of this block be made to fit easy in the
barrel C, and cloath the cases so that
they may all light together; and let a
pipe be carried through a hole in the
block into the barrel C, in order to receive
the fire from the leader brought
from the last case on the wheel. G, the
nave of the fifth mutation, whose diameter
must be four inches and a half;
in this nave fix ten or twelve spokes
one foot and a half in length each; these
spokes must stand seven inches distance
from the spokes of the fourth mutation;
and at the end of each spoke tie a four
ounce case, as shewn by <abbr title="Number">Nᵒ.</abbr> 5; all these
cases are to be lighted together, by a
leader brought from the end of one of
<a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a><span class="pageno">230</span>
the cases on <abbr title="Number">Nᵒ.</abbr> 4. Let F and H be
of the same piece of wood as E and G;
but as much thinner as possible, in order
to make the work light.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Sixth and Seventh Mutation.</p>

<p>The blocks of these two mutations,
are turned out of one piece of wood,
whose length from F to P is fifteen
inches. L a block five inches diameter,
in which are fixed eight spokes, each
two feet four inches in length; at the
end of each spoke tie two four ounce
cases as shewn by <abbr title="Number">Nᵒ.</abbr> 6; all these cases
must be fired at the same time, by a
pipe brought from the end of one of the
cases on the fifth mutation. Let the
distance between the spokes at L and
those in the fifth mutation be seven
inches. M, the nave of the seventh
mutation, whose diameter must be five
inches and a half; in this nave fix eight
spokes, and on the front of them two
circular fells, one of four feet eight
diameter, and one of three feet eleven
inches diameter; on these fells, tie sixteen
eight ounce or pound cases, in the
same manner as represented by <abbr title="Number">Nᵒ.</abbr> 7,
<a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a><span class="pageno">231</span>
and carry leaders from one to the other,
so that they may be all fired together;
this mutation must be fired by a leader
brought from the tail of one of the cases
on the sixth mutation.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Eighth and Ninth Mutation.</p>

<p>The blocks of these may be turned
out of one piece, whose length from P
to D must be twelve inches. O, the
block of the eighth mutation, which
must be six inches diameter, and in it
fixed six spokes, each three feet in
length; these spokes must be strengthened
by a hexagon fell within three or
four inches of the ends of the spokes;
close to the end of each spoke, in the
front, fix a five-pointed brilliant star;
then seven inches below each star tie
two ten inch eight ounce cases, so that
the upper ends of the cases may rest on
the fells, and their ends on the spokes;
each of these cases must be placed parallel
to the opposite fell, see <abbr title="Number">Nᵒ.</abbr> 8.
NNN, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> are the cases, and kkk, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>
the stars.</p>

<p>The ninth mutation must be thus
made; let D be a block seven inches
diameter; in this block must be screwed
<a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a><span class="pageno">232</span>
six spokes, six feet in length each, with
holes and grooves in them for leaders,
in the same manner as those in the
dodecaedron; at the end of each spoke,
in the front, fix a spindle for a hexagon
vertical wheel, ten inches diameter, as
shewn by <abbr title="Number">Nᵒ.</abbr> 9. When these wheels
are on, carry a leader from each into
the block, so that they may all meet
together; then lead a pipe from the end
of one of the cases of the eighth mutation,
through a hole bored in the block
D, to meet the leaders from the vertical
wheels, so that they may all be fired
together.</p>

<p>The spindles for large pieces are required
to be made very strong, and as
exact as possible; for a piece of nine
mutations, let the spindle be at the
large end one inch diameter, and continue
that thickness as far as the seventh
mutation, and from thence to the fifth;
let its diameter be three quarters of an
inch; from the fifth to the fourth, five
eighths of an inch; from the fourth to
the second, half an inch; and from the
second to the end, three eighths of an
inch: at the small end must be a nut
to keep on the first wheel, and at the
thick end must be a large nut, as shewn
<a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a><span class="pageno">233</span>
by the figure, so that the screw part of
the spindle being put through a post,
and a nut screwed on tight, the spindle
will be held fast and steady; but you
are to observe, that that part of the
spindle, on which the moveable pieces
are to run, be made long enough for the
wheels to run easy without sticking;
the fixed pieces being made on different
blocks, the leaders must be joined, after
they are fixed on the spindle. The best
method of preventing the fixed mutations
from moving on the spindle, is,
to make that part of the spindle which
goes through them square; but as it
would be difficult to make square holes
through such long blocks as are sometimes
required, it will be best to make
them in the following manner; which
is, to bore a round hole a little larger
than the diameter of the spindle, and
at each end of the block over the hole,
fasten a piece of brass with a square
hole in it to fit the spindle.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">To make a Horizontal Wheel
change to a Vertical Wheel with
a Sun in Front.</p>

<p>The sudden change of this piece is
very pleasing, and gives great surprize
to those who are not acquainted with
the contrivance. A wheel for this purpose
should be about three feet diameter,
and its fell circular, on which
tie sixteen half pound cases filled with
brilliant charge; two of these cases
must burn at a time, and on each end
of the nave must be a tin barrel of the
same construction as those on the regulated
piece; the wheel being compleated,
prepare the post or stand after the
following manner: first have a stand
made of any height, about three or four
inches square, then saw off from the
top, a piece two feet in length; this
piece join again at the place where it
was cut, with a hinge on one side, so
that it may lift up and down in the
front of the stand, then fix on the top
of the bottom part of the stand, on each
side a bracket; these brackets must project
at right angles with the stand, one
<a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a><span class="pageno">235</span>
foot from the front, for the short piece
to rest on; but these brackets must be
placed a little above the joint of the post,
so that when the upper stand falls, it
may lay between them at right angles
with the bottom stand, which may be
done by fixing a piece of wood, one
foot in length, between the brackets and
even with the top of the bottom stand;
then, as the brackets rise above the bottom
stand, they will form a channel for
the short post to lay in, and at the same
time keep it steady without straining
the hinge: on the side of the short post
opposite the hinge, nail a piece of wood;
this piece must be of such a length,
that, when the post is perpendicular, it
may reach about one foot and a half
down the long post, to which being
tied, it will hold the short stand upright;
the stand being thus prepared, in the
top of it fix a spindle ten inches in
length; on this spindle put the wheel,
then fix on a brilliant sun with a single
glory; the diameter of this sun must
be six inches less than that of the wheel.
When you fire this piece, light the
wheel first, and let it run horizontally
till four cases are consumed; then from
the end of the fourth case carry a leader
<a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a><span class="pageno">236</span>
into the ten barrel that turns over the
end of the stand; this leader must be
met by another brought through the
top of the post, from a case filled with
a strong port-fire charge, and tied to
the bottom post, with its mouth facing
the pack-thread which holds up the
stand, so that when this case is lighted,
it will burn the pack-thread, and let the
wheel fall forward, by which means it
will become vertical; then from the
last case of the wheel, carry a leader
into the barrel next the sun, which will
begin as soon as the wheel is burnt out.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of the grand Volute illuminated
with a projected Wheel in
Front.</p>

<p>First have two hoops made of strong
iron wire, one of six feet diameter, and
one of four feet two inches; these hoops
must be joined to scroles A, A, A, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> as
shewn by <a href="#illo5">fig. 54.</a> These scroles must
be made of the same sort of wire as the
hoops; on these scroles, tie with iron
binding wire as many illuminating port
fires as they will hold, at two inches
distance from each other; these port
<a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a><span class="pageno">237</span>
fires cloath with leaders, so that they
may all take fire together; then let C be
a circular wheel of four spokes, three
feet six inches diameter, and on its fell
tie as many four ounce cases head to
tail, as will compleat the circle, only
allowing a sufficient distance between
the cases, that the fire may pass free,
which may be done by cutting the
upper part of the end of each case a little
shelving: on each spoke fix a four
ounce case about three inches from the
fell of the wheel; these cases are to burn
one at a time, and the first of them to
begin with those on the fell, of which
four are to burn at a time, so that the
wheel will last no longer than one fourth
of the cases on the fell, which in number
should be sixteen or twenty; on the
front of the wheel form a spiral line,
with strong wire, on which tie port fires,
placing them on a slant, with their
mouths to face the same way as the
cases on the wheel; all these port fires
must be fired with the second cases of
wheel. Let D, D, D, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> be spokes of
wood, all made to screw into a block in
the center; each of these spokes may be
in length about four feet six inches; in
the top of each fix a spindle, and on each
<a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a><span class="pageno">238</span>
spindle put a spirali wheel of eight spokes,
such as are represented by E, E, E, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>
The blocks of these wheels must have
a hole at top for the center cases, and
the spindle must have nuts screwed on
their ends, which nuts should fit in the
holes at top of the blocks, so that all
the wheels, must be put on before you
fix in the center cases: as some of these
wheels by reason of their situation will
not bear on the nut, it will be necessary
to have smooth shoulders made on the
spindles for the blocks to run on; the
cases of these wheels are to burn double,
and the method of firing them is, by
carrying a leader from each down the
spokes into the block in the center, in
the same manner as those in the dodecaedron,
but the center case of each
wheel, must begin with the two last
cases as usual; it is to be observed, that
the large circular wheel in front must
have a tin barrel on its block, into which
a pipe must be carried, from one of the
second cases on the wheel; this pipe
being met by another from the large
block, in which the eight spokes are
screwed, will fire all the spirali wheels
and the illuminating port fires at the
same time. The cases of the projected
<a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a><span class="pageno">239</span>
wheel may be filled with a white
charge, and those of the spirali wheels,
with a grey.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of the Moon and Seven Stars.</p>

<p>Let <a href="#illo5">fig. 55</a>, be a smooth circular
board, six feet diameter; out of the
middle of it cut a circular piece twelve
or fourteen inches diameter, and over
the vacancy put white Persian silk, on
which paint a moon’s face, then let
I, I, I, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> be stars each four or five
inches diameter, cut out with five
points, and covered with oiled silk: on
the front of the large circular board,
draw a seven-pointed star, as large as the
circle will allow; then on the lines
which form this star, bore holes, wherein
fix pointed stars. When this piece
is to be fired, it must be fixed upon the
front of a post, on a spindle, with a
wheel of brilliant fire behind the face
of the moon; so that while the wheel
burns, the moon and stars will appear
transparent, and when the wheel has
burnt out, they will disappear, and the
large star in front, which is formed of
pointed stars, will begin, being lighted
<a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a><span class="pageno">240</span>
by a pipe of communication from the
last case of the vertical wheel, behind
the moon; this pipe of communication
must be managed in the same manner as
those in regulated pieces.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of the Double Cone Wheel illuminated.</p>

<p>This piece is represented by fig 56.
Let A, be a strong decagon wheel, two
feet six inches diameter; then on each
side of it fix a cone B and C; these cones
are to consist of a number of hoops,
supported by three or four pieces of
wood, in the manner of the spiral
wheels; let the height of each cone be
three feet six inches, and on all the
hoops tie port fires horizontally, with
their mouths outwards, and cloath the
wheel with eight ounce cases, all to
play horizontally, two at a time: the
cones may be fired with the first or
second cases. The spindle for this piece
must go through both the cones, and
rise three feet above the point of the
cone at top, so that its length will be
ten feet four inches from the top of the
post H, in which it is fixed, allowing
<a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a><span class="pageno">241</span>
four inches for the thickness of the
block of the wheel; the whole weight
of the wheel and cones must bear on a
shoulder in the spindle, on which the
block of the wheel must turn; near the
top of the spindle, must be a hole in the
front, into which screw a small spindle,
after the cones are on; then on this
small spindle fix a sun D, composed of
sixteen nine inch four ounce cases of
brilliant fire, which cases must not be
placed on a fell, but only stuck into a
block of six inches diameter; then in
the front of this sun must be a circular
vertical wheel, sixteen inches diameter;
on the front of this wheel form with
iron wire a spiral line, and cloath it
with illuminations, after the usual method;
as this wheel is not to be fired
till the cones are burnt out, the method
of firing it is as follows; let the hole in
the block, at the top of the uppermost
cone, be a little larger than the spindle
which passes through it; then from the
first case of the vertical wheel before the
sun, carry a leader down the side of the
spindle to the top of the block of the
horizontal wheel, on which must be a
tin barrel; then this leader, being met
by another brought from the end of the
<a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a><span class="pageno">242</span>
last case of the horizontal wheel, will
give fire to the vertical wheel, as soon
as the cones are extinguished; but the
sun D must not be fired, till the vertical
wheel is quite burnt out.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of Fire Pumps.</p>

<p>Cases for fire pumps, are made in the
same manner as those for tourbillons,
only they are parted instead of being
rolled dry. Having rolled and dryed your
cases, fill them in the following manner:
first put in a little meal powder, and
then a star, on which ram lightly a ladle
or two of composition, then a little meal
powder, and on that a star, then again
composition, and so on till you have
filled the case. Stars for fire pumps
should not be round, but must be made
either square, or flat and circular, with
a hole through the middle; the quantity
of powder for throwing the stars
must increase as you come near the top
of the case, for if much powder be put
at the bottom, it will burst the case.
The stars must differ in size, in this
manner; let the star which you put in
first, be about one fourth less than the bore
<a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a><span class="pageno">243</span>
of the case, but let the next star be a
little larger, and the third star a little
larger than the second, and so on; let
them increase in diameter, till within
two of the top of the case, which two
must fit in tight. As the loading of fire
pumps is somewhat difficult, it will be
necessary to make two or three trials,
before you depend on their performance:
when you fill a number of pumps,
take care not to put in each an equal
quantity of charge between the stars, so
that when they are fired they may not
throw up too many stars together.
Cases for fire pumps should be made
very strong, and rolled on four or eight
ounce formers, ten or twelve inches in
length each.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of the Vertical Scroll Wheel.</p>

<p>This wheel may be made of any diameter,
but must be constructed as shewn
by <a href="#illo5">fig. 57</a>, to do which proceed thus;
have a block made of a moderate size,
into which fix four flat spokes, and on
them fix a flat circular fell of wood;
round the front of this fell place port-fires;
then on the front of the spokes
<a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a><span class="pageno">244</span>
form a scrole, either with a hoop or
strong iron wire; on this scrole tie cases
of brilliant fire, in proportion to the
wheel, head to tail, as in the figure;
when you fire this wheel, light the first
case near the fell; then, as the cases fire
successively, you will see the circle of
fire gradually diminish; but whether the
illuminations on the fell begin with the
scrole or not, is immaterial, that being
left intirely to the maker.</p>

<p class="hanging">N. B. This wheel may be put in the
front of a regulated piece, or fired by
itself, occasionally.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of Pin Wheels.</p>

<p>First roll some paper pipes, about
fourteen inches in length each; these
pipes must not be made thick of paper,
two or three rounds of elephant paper
being sufficient; when your pipes are
thoroughly dryed, you must have made
a tin tube, twelve inches in length, to
fit easy into the pipes; at one end of this
tube fix a small conical cup, which being
done, it is called a funnel, then bend
one end of one of the pipes, and put the
funnel in at the other, as far as it will
<a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a><span class="pageno">245</span>
reach, and fill the cup with composition;
then draw out the funnel by a little at
a time, shaking it up and down, and it
will fill the pipe as it comes out; having
filled some pipes, have made some
small blocks, about an inch diameter,
and half an inch in thickness; round one
of these blocks wind and paste a pipe,
and to the end of this pipe join another,
which must be done by twisting the end
of one pipe to a point, and putting it
into the end of the other, with a little
paste; in this manner join four or five
pipes, winding them one upon the other,
so as to form a spiral line; having
wound on your pipes, paste two slips
of paper across them, to hold them together;
besides these slips of paper, the
pipes must be pasted together.</p>

<p>There is another method of making
these wheels, called the French method;
which is, by winding on the pipes without
paste, and sticking them together
with sealing wax, at every half turn; so
that when they are fired, the end will
fall loose every time the fire passes the
wax, by which means the circle of fire
will be considerably increased. The
formers for these pipes are made from
one and a half to four sixteenths of an
<a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a><span class="pageno">246</span>
inch diameter, and the composition for
them as follows; meal powder eight
ounces, salt petre two ounces, and sulphur
one; among these ingredients,
may be mixed a little steel-filings, or
the dust of cast-iron; this composition
should be very dry, and not made too
fine, or it will stick in the funnel. These
wheels may be fired on a large pin, and
held in the hand with safety.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Of Fire Globes.</p>

<p>There are two sorts of fire globes,
one with projected cases, and the other
with the cases concealed in the following
manner; have a globe made of
wood, of any diameter you chuse, and
divide the surface of it into fourteen
equal parts, and at each division bore a
hole perpendicular to the center; these
holes must be in proportion to the cases
intended to be used; in every hole, except
one, put a case filled with brilliant,
or any other charge, and let the mouths
of the cases be even with the surface of
the globe; then cut in the globe a groove,
from the mouth of one case to the other,
for leaders, which must be carried from
<a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a><span class="pageno">247</span>
case to case, so that they may all be
fired together; this being done, cover
the globe with a single paper, and paint
it. These sort of globes may be used
to ornament a building.</p>

<p>Fire-globes with projected cases are
made thus; your globe being made with
fourteen holes bored in it as usual, six
in every hole, except one, a case, and let
each case project from the globe two
thirds of its length; then cloath all the
cases with leaders, so that they may all
take fire at the same time. Fire-globes
are supported by a pintle, made to fit
the hole in which there is no case.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">To thread and join Leaders, with
the method of placing them on
different Works.</p>

<p>Joining and placing of Leaders is a
very essential part of fireworks, as it is
on the leaders, that the performance of
all complex works depend; for which
reason I shall endeavour here to explain
the method of conducting pipes of communication,
in as plain a manner as
possible. Your works being ready to be
cloathed, proceed thus; cut your pipes
<a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a><span class="pageno">248</span>
of a sufficient length to reach from one
case to the other, then put in the quick
match, which must always be made to
go in very easy; when the match is in,
cut it off within about an inch of the
end of the pipe, and let it project as
much at the other end; then fasten the
pipe to the mouth of each case with a
pin, and put the loose ends of the
match into the mouths of the cases,
with a little meal powder; this being
done to all the cases, paste over the
mouth of each two or three bits of
paper; the preceding method is used
for large cases, and the following for
small cases and illuminations; first
thread a long pipe, then lay it on the
tops of the cases, and cut a bit off the
under side, exactly over the mouth of
each case, so that the match may appear;
then pin the pipe to every other
case, but before you put on the pipes,
put a little meal powder in the mouth
of each case; if the cases thus cloathed
be port-fires on illuminated works,
cover the mouth of each case with a
single paper; but if they are choaked
cases, situated so that a number of sparks
from other works may fall on them before
they are fired, secure them with
<a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a><span class="pageno">249</span>
three or four papers, which must be
pasted on very smooth, that there may
be no creases for the sparks to lodge in,
which often set fire to the works before
their time; avoid, as much as possible,
placing the leaders too near together, or
one across the other so as to touch, as it
sometimes happens that the flash of one
will fire the other; therefore if your
works should be so formed, that the
leaders must cross or touch, be sure to
make them very strong, and secure
them well at the joints and at every
opening.</p>

<p>When a great length of pipe is required,
it must be made by joining
several pipes together, in this manner;
having put on one length of match as
many pipes as it will hold, paste paper
over every joint; but if a still greater
length be required, more pipes must be
joined, by cutting off about an inch of
one side of each pipe near the end, and
laying the quick match together, and
tieing them fast with small twine; after
which, cover the joining with pasted
paper.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">The manner of placing Fireworks
to be exhibited, with the order
of Firing.</p>

<p>Nothing adds more to the appearance
of fireworks, than the placing them properly;
though the manner of placing
them chiefly depends on the judgment
of the maker. I shall give such rules
here, as have been generally observed;
for example, whether your works are
to be fired on a building, or on stands;
if they are a double set, place one
wheel of a sort on each side of the building,
and next to each of them towards
the center, place a fixed piece, then
wheels, and so on, leaving a sufficient
distance between them, for the fire to
play from one without burning the
other; having fixed some of your works
thus in front, place the rest behind
them, in the center of their intervals;
the largest piece, which is generally a
regulated or transparent piece, must be
placed in the center of the building,
and behind it a sun, which must always
stand above all the other works: a little
<a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a><span class="pageno">251</span>
before the building or stands place your
large gerbes, and at the back of the
works, fix your marron batteries, pots
des aigrettes, pots des brins, pots des
saucissons, air ballóóns, and flights of
rockets; the rocket stands may be fixed
behind or any where else, so as not to
be in the way of the works.</p>

<p>Single collections are fired on stands,
which stands are made in the same manner
as theodolite stands, only the top
part must be long or short occasionally;
these sort of stands may be fixed up
very soon without much trouble. Having
given sufficient instructions for
placing of fireworks, I shall proceed with
the manner of firing them.</p>

<p>When water-works are to be exhibited, divide them
into several sets, and fire one set after every fifth or sixth
change of land and air-works; and observe this rule in
firing in a double set of works, always to begin with
sky-rockets, then two moveable pieces, then two fix’d
pieces, and so on, ending with a large flight of rockets,
or a marron battery; if a single collection, fire a fixed
piece after every wheel or two, and now and then some
air and water-works.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Fountain of Sky-Rockets.</p>

<p><a href="#illo6">Plate 6th.</a> Fig. 1st, represents a fountain of thirty
rockets; let A, be a perpendicular post, sixteen feet
high from the ground, and four inches square. Let
the rail or cross piece C, be one foot six inches in
<a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a><span class="pageno">254</span>
length, three inches broad, and one thick. The rail D,
at bottom, must be six feet in length, one foot broad,
and an inch thick. F, and G, are the two sides which
serve to supply the rails D, E, H, I, C; these sides are
one foot broad at bottom, and cut in the front with a
regular slope, to three inches at top, but their back edges
must be parallel with the front of the pots A. The breadth
of the rails E, H, I, will be determined by the breadth
of the sides; all the rails must be fixed at two feet distance
from each other, and at right angles with the pots;
having placed the rails thus; bore in the bottom rail, ten
holes at equal distances from each other, large enough to
receive easily the stick of a one pound rocket; in the
back edge of this rail cut a groove from one end to the
other, fit to contain a quick-match, then cut a groove
in the top of the rail, from the edge of each hole, into
the groove in the back; in the same manner cut in the
second rail E, eight holes and grooves; in the third rail H,
six holes and grooves; in the fourth rail I, four holes and
grooves; and in the top rail two holes and grooves; B, a
rail with holes in it to guide the ends of the rocket sticks,
this rail must be fixed six feet from the rail D; the fountain
frame being thus made, prepare your rockets thus;
tie round the mouth of each a piece of thin paper, large
enough to go twice round, and to project about an inch
and a half from the mouth of the rocket, which must be
rubbed with wet meal-powder; in the mouth of each
Rocket put a leader, which secure well with the paper
that projects from the mouth of the case; these leaders
must be carried into the grooves in the back of the rails, in
which lay a quick-match from one end to the other, and
cover it with pasted paper; holes must be made in the
rail D, to receive the ends of the sticks of the rockets, in
the rail E, and so on to the fourth rail, so that the sticks
of the rockets at top, will go through all the rails; the
rockets being so prepared, fix a gerbe or white flower-pot
on each rail before the post, with their mouths inclining a
little forwards; these gerbes must be lighted all at once;
<a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a><span class="pageno">255</span>
behind or before each gerbe, fix a case of brilliant or slow
fire, these cases must be filled so that they may burn out
one after the other, to regulate the fountain, which may
be done by carrying a leader, from the end of each slow
or brilliant fire, into the groove in the back of each rail;
different size rockets may be used in these fountains, but it
will be best to fill the heads of the rockets on each rail with
different sorts of things, in this manner, those at top with
crackers, the next with rains, the third with serpents, the
fourth with tailed stars, and the last flight with common
or brilliant stars.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Palm-Tree.</p>

<p>This piece, though made of common fires, and of a
simple construction, has a very pleasing effect; owing
to the fires intersecting so often, that they resemble the
branches of trees. <a href="#illo6">Fig. <abbr title="second">2d.</abbr></a> let A, be a perpendicular
post of any thickness so that it be sufficiently strong
to hold the cases; let the distance from B to C, be two
feet six inches, and from C to D, two feet six inches, and
let the length of each cross piece be two feet; on each
end of each, fix a five pointed star, then fix on pegs made
on purpose, twelve inch half pound cases of brilliant fire,
as in the figure, all the cases and stars, must be fired at
one time; this piece should be fixed high from the ground.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Illuminated Pyramid, with Archimedian
Screws, a Globe and Vertical Sun.</p>

<p>May be made of any size; one made according to
the Dimensions of <a href="#illo6">fig. <abbr title="third">3d</abbr></a>, will be a good proportion,
whose whole height is twenty one feet; from C to D,
six feet, from E to F, nine feet, the space between
the rails must be six inches, and the rails as thin as possible,
in all the rails stick port-fires at four inches distance;
the archimedian screws G, K, are nothing more than
<a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a><span class="pageno">256</span>
double spiral wheels, with the cases placed on their wheels
horizontally instead of obliquely, the vertical sun I, need
not consist of more than twelve rays, to form a single
glory; the globe at top must be made in proportion to
the pyramid, which being prepared according to the
preceding directions, place your leaders so that all the
illuminating port-fires, screws, globe, and sun, may take
fire together; the pyramid must be supported by the
two sides, and by a support brought from a pole, which
must be placed two feet from the back of the pyramid,
in order that the wheels may run free.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Rose-Piece and Sun.</p>

<p>A rose piece may be used for a mutation of a regulated
piece, or fired by itself, this piece makes the best appearance
when made large; if its exterior diameter be
six feet it will be a good size; <a href="#illo6">fig. 4</a>, shews the manner
it appears before it is fired; let the exterior fell be made
of wood, and supported by four wooden spokes, all
the other parts on which the illuminations are fixed,
must be made of strong iron wire; on the exterior
fell, place as many half pound cases of brilliant charge as
you think proper (but the more the better) for the nearer
the cases are placed, the stronger will be the rays of the
Sun; the illuminations should be placed within three
inches of each other, they must be all fired together and
burn some time before the sun is lighted, which may be
done by carrying a leader from the middle of one of the
illuminations, to the mouth of one of the sun cases.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Transparent Stars with Illuminated Rays.</p>

<p><a href="#illo7">Plate 7</a>, Fig. 5th, represents an illuminated star, let
the diameter from A to B, be two feet and from C to D,
seven feet; first make a strong circular back or body of
the star, two feet diameter, to which you fix the illuminated
<a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a><span class="pageno">257</span>
rays; in the center of the front of the body fix a spindle, on
which put a double triangular wheel, six inches diameter,
clothed with two ounce cases of brilliant charge; the
cases on this wheel must burn but one at a time; round
the edge of the body nail a hoop made of thin wood or
tin, this hoop must project in front six or seven inches;
in this hoop cut three or four holes to let out the
smoke from the wheel; the star and garter may
be cut out of strong paste-board or tin, made in this
manner, cut a round piece of paste-board or tin, two
feet diameter, on which draw a star, and cut it out, then
over the vacancy paste Persian silk; paint the letters
yellow; four of the rays yellow, and four red; the cross
in the middle may be painted half red, and half yellow,
or yellow and blue; this transparent star must be fastened
to the wooden hoop by a screw, to take off and on, the
illuminated rays are made of thin wood, with tin sockets
fixed on their sides within four inches of each other; in
these sockets stick illuminating port-fires; behind the
point of each ray, fix a half pound case of grey, black,
or chinese fire.</p>

<p class="center">* &emsp; * &emsp; * &emsp; * &emsp; *</p>

<p class="hanging">N. B. The illuminated rays to be lighted at the same
time as the triangular wheel, or after it is burnt out,
which may be done by a tin barrel being fixed to the
wheel after the manner of those in the regulated pieces,
into this barrel correl a leader from the illuminated rays,
through the back of the star, which leader must be met
by another brought from the tail of the last case on the
wheel.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Transparent Table Star Illuminated.</p>

<p><a href="#illo7">Fig. 6th</a>, represents a table star, whose diameter from
E to F, is twelve feet, and from E to I, four feet,
this proportion observed on each side, will make the center
frame four feet square, in this square fix a transparent
star, as shewn in the figure; this star may be painted
blue, and its rays made as those of the flaming stars
<a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a><span class="pageno">258</span>
described in page 218, the wheel for this star may be
composed of different coloured fires, with a change or
two of slow fire; the wheels a, a, a, a, may be clothed
with any number of cases, so that the star wheel consists
of the same; the illuminating port fires, which must be
placed very near each other on the frames, must be so
managed as to burn as long as the wheels, and lighted at
the time.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">The Regulated Illuminated Spirili Piece,
with a projected Star Wheel Illuminated.</p>

<p>This piece is represented by <a href="#illo7">Fig. 7th</a>, and is thus
made; have a block made eight inches diameter, in
this block screw six iron spokes, which must serve for
spindles for the spiral wheels, these wheels are made as
usual, each one foot six inches diameter and three foot in
height; the spindles must be long enough to keep the
wheels four or five inches from one another; at the end of
each spindle must be a screw nut, on which the wheels
that hang downwards will run, and on the spindles which
stand upwards must be a shoulder, for the blocks of the
wheels to run on.</p>

<p class="center">* &emsp; * &emsp; * &emsp; * &emsp; *</p>

<p>The projected star wheel, must turn on the same spindle
on which the large block is fixed, this spindle must
be long enough to allow the star wheel to project a little
before the spiral wheels; the exterior diameter of the star
wheel, must be three feet five inches, on this wheel fix
three circles of iron wire, and on them port-fires; on the
block place a transparent star, or a large five pointed brilliant
star, the cases on this wheel may burn four at once,
as it will contain near twice the number of one of the
spiral wheels; the cases on the spiral wheels, must be
placed parallel to their fells, and burn two at a time.</p>

<a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a><span class="pageno">259</span>
<p class="p2 center larger">A New Figure Piece Illuminated with
Five Pointed Stars.</p>

<p>The construction of this piece is very easy, as shewn
by figure 8, whose diameter from B to C, is eight
feet, and from D to E, two feet, the vertical wheel in the
center, must be one foot diameter, and consist of six four
ounce cases of different coloured charge, which cases must
burn double; on the frames of this piece, six five pointed
brilliant or blue stars, rammed four inches with composition,
let the space between each star be eight inches;
at each point of this piece, fix a gerbe or case of chinese
fire; when this piece is to be fired let the gerbes, stars,
and wheel be lighted at the same time.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">The Star Wheel Illuminated.</p>

<p>This beautiful new invented piece, is shewn in
<a href="#illo8">Plate 8</a>, fig. 9, its exterior fell is made of wood, three
feet six inches or four feet diameter, within this fell,
form with iron wire, three circles, one less than the other,
so that the diameter of the least may be about ten inches;
place the port-fires on these fells, with their mouths inclining
outwards, and the port-fires on the points of the
star, with their mouths projecting in front; let the exterior
fell be clothed with four ounce cases of grey charge,
these cases must burn four at a time, and be lighted at the
same time as the illuminations.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">Pyramid of Flower-pots.</p>

<p><a href="#illo8">Fig. 10</a>, represents this curious piece, which must be
made thus; let the distance from A to B, be six
feet, and from one rail to the other two; on the bottom
rail, fix five paper mortars, each three inches and a half
diameter, these mortars load with serpents, crackers,
stars, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a><span class="pageno">260</span>
<p>In the center of each mortar fix a case of spur fire; on
the second rail fix four mortars, so as to stand exactly in
the middle of the intervals of them on the bottom rail;
on the third rail place three mortars; on the fourth two;
and on the top of the posts one; the bottom rail must be
six feet in length; all the mortars must incline a little forwards,
that they may easily discharge themselves, and
the spur-fires rammed exactly alike that the mortars may
all be fired at the same time, having prepared your pyramid
according to the preceeding directions, carry pipes of
communication, from one spur-fire to the other.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">The Illuminated Regulating Piece.</p>

<p><a href="#illo8">Fig. 11</a>, represents one half of this piece; A, A,
A, A, are flat wooden spokes, each five feet in length,
and at the end of each, place a vertical wheel, ten
inches diameter, clothed with six four ounce cases of
brilliant fire, these cases must burn but one at a time;
on two of the spokes of each wheel, place two port-fires,
which must be lighted with the first case of the wheel;
on each spoke A, A, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> behind the wheels place six
cases of the same size as them on the wheels; these cases
must be tied across the spokes with their mouths all one
way, and be made to take fire successively one after the
other, so that they may assist the whole pieces to turn round.</p>

<p>The diameter of the wheel B, must be two feet six
inches, and its fell made of wood, which must be fixed
to the large spokes, on this wheel place twenty four cases
of the same sort as them on the small wheels, these cases
must burn four at a time; in this wheel make three circles
with iron wire, and on them place illuminating port-fires,
as shewn in the figure; the star points on the large
spokes may be made of thin ash hoops, the diameter of
these points close to the center wheel must be eleven
inches; on these points place port-fires, at three inches
and a half distance, one from the other.</p>

<p><a href="#illo8">Fig. 12</a>, represents the blocks of this piece, the diameters
of these blocks at A and B, must be eight inches
<a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a><span class="pageno">261</span>
and C and D, four inches and a half, the length of each,
of these blocks must be six inches; at the small ends of
these blocks fix an iron wheel five inches diameter,
which wheels must have teeth, to turn the wheel E, this
wheel which is fixed on a small spindle screwed into the
large spindle which goes through the two blocks, and on
which they run.</p>

<p class="center">* &emsp; * &emsp; * &emsp; * &emsp; *</p>

<p>Supposing <a href="#illo8">fig. 11</a>, to be on the block A, in <a href="#illo8">fig. 12</a>,
and to turn to the right, and another piece of the same
construction on the block B, with its fires placed so as to
turn it to the left, you will find them move very true and
fast, by the help of the three iron wheels, which serves to
regulate their motions, as well as to assist them in turning;
let the iron circles in the front of the great wheels be of
different diameters so that when fired there may appear six
circles, when this piece is fired, all the wheels and illuminations
must be lighted at one time.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">To Fix a Sky-Rocket with its Stick, on the
top of another.</p>

<p>Rockets thus managed make a pretty appearance, by
reason of a fresh tail being seen when the second rocket
takes fire, which will mount to a great height; the method
of preparing these rockets is thus, having filled a two
pounder, which must be filled only half a diameter above
the piercer, and in its head not more than ten or twelve
stars; the stick of this rocket must be made a little thicker
than common, and when made, cut it in half the flat way,
and in each half make a groove, so that when the two
halves are joined, the hollow made by the grooves may be
large enough to hold the stick of a half pound rocket,
which rocket make and head as usual, the stick of this rocket
put into the hollow of the large one, so far that the mouth
of the rocket may rest on the head of the two pounder;
from whose head carry a leader into the mouth of the small
rocket, which being done, your rockets will be ready
for fireing.</p>

<a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a><span class="pageno">262</span>
<p class="p2 center larger">A New Method of placing Leaders.</p>

<p>The placing leaders, on small cases or illuminations,
is a much quicker, stronger, and more expeditious way
than that of using pins, which method has been practised
till very lately. Your port-fires being filled within about
three eighths of an inch of the top, bore with an awl a
hole through each side of the case close to the composition,
then fill the mouths of the cases with meal powder wetted
with spirit of wine, when you have thus prepared your
cases, fix them on your works, then take an empty leader,
and lay it on the mouths of as many cases as it will reach,
then with your finger nail, mark the leader exactly in the
middle of the mouth of each case, then at each mark with
a pair of Scissars, cut a bit out of the pipe, so that when
you put in the quick-match, it may be seen; this being
done, lay the leader on the cases again with that side on
which the match is seen downwards; then take some small
twine, and put it through the holes in the mouths of the
cases, and tie on the leader; do this to every case and
then cover them with single pasted paper; by making
use of the above method your works may be made very
clean, there being no occasion to put dry meal powder in
the mouths of the cases which always soils the works and
prevents the paste from sticking.</p>

<p>In this treatise, I have taught the method of rolling,
pinching, and filling all sorts of cases, the manner of
pulverizing, mixing, and preparing, all compositions
used in artificial fire-works; also the method of placing
leaders, clothing wheels, fixed pieces, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> in so plain
a manner, that all fire-works may be made without
any further instructions. A variety of pyrotechnical representations
only depends on the genius of the maker,
by fixing different cases and fires on works of various
forms, of which there are many more.</p>

<p>But as those I have given are the principal, I shall conclude,
till I have an opportunity of extending this work,
which will depend on the approbation it meets with.</p>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few

Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
